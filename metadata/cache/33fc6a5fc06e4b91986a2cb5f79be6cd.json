        "description": "<p>Current paper presents a low-latency, scalable and FPGA-implementable 256-channel re-configurable sample rate converter<br>optimized for high-throughput medical systems like 3T-MRI machines. The architecture eliminates the need for filters or DSPs (Digital Signal&nbsp;Processing)by using per-channel buffering, counter-based decimation, and indexed output sequencing, resulting in a design that is resourceefficient, real-time, and deployable on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) with limited I/O (Input-outputs). The design supports 100&nbsp;MHz operation and is validated through simulation and synthesis, offering significant improvements over traditional converter architectures.&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>With the harmful effects of fossil fuel combustion on the environment, in addition to limited stock of&nbsp;fossil fuel, has forced many countries to inquire into and change to eco-friendly alternatives that are renewable&nbsp;to sustain the increasing energy demand. Though there is prospect of power generation from renewable energy&nbsp;sources such as wind, solar, geo-thermal, biomass, etc, solar and wind power generation are two of the most&nbsp;promising renewable power generation technologies.&nbsp;In general, solar and wind powers are complementary in nature. Therefore, the hybrid photo-voltaic and wind&nbsp;energy system has higher dependability to give steady power and deliver power to the load mutually or&nbsp;independently. In solar photo-voltaic system, MPPT technique is applied to maximize power output. In wind&nbsp;energy conversion system, PMSG (PERMANENT MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR) is driven&nbsp;by wind turbine with zero pitch angle.&nbsp;In this paper, the architecture with modelling and simulation of hybrid solar photo-voltaic and wind&nbsp;energy sources has been provided. The simulation of solar photovoltaic and PMSG based wind hybrid system&nbsp;has been carried out with MATLAB/SIMULINK and simulation results are provided.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nyepi</em>&nbsp;Day in Bali is a unique Hindu religious celebration, marked by a complete cessation of outdoor activities for 24 hours. This condition has a significant impact on energy consumption, especially fuel. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of fuel needs during the&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em>&nbsp;period based on consumption simulation data in Bali Province. The method used is a case study with a baseline of daily fuel consumption of 3.2 million litres, and an assumption of fuel consumption reductions of 30% on the day before&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em>&nbsp;(D-1), 90% on&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em>, and 25% on the day after&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em>&nbsp;(D+1). The simulation results show a total savings of approximately 5.36 million litres of fuel over three days, equivalent to a reduction in CO\u2082 emissions of roughly 12,857 tons. This discussion connects these findings with previous studies on the impact of&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em>&nbsp;on air quality and demand-side energy management strategies. This study recommends utilising&nbsp;<em>Nyepi</em> as a model for energy-saving policies in other regions through planned mobility restrictions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This research investigates the viability of a perpetually scalable generation system to accommodate the anticipated growth in domestic load demands on the 33 kV loop network over the period from 2025 to 2040. This is achieved by analysis current situation of network through the voltages, loading lines, and transformers, within the permissible loading limits of the system. In this context, it is assumed that the loop is supplied by an ideal infinite power source. A numerical model utilizing the Gauss-Seidel (GS) method is developed and executed within the PSS/E simulator. The current operational state of the network will be simulated, with a focus on analyzing the voltage profile, which is expected to remain within the range of 0.095 to 1.05 per unit (p.u.). Demand forecasts are based on industrial growth projections for the cities interconnected with the 33 kV loop. The simulation results will demonstrate the feasibility of increasing active power transmission while maintaining effective control over reactive power by the year 2040. Furthermore, solutions will be proposed to address the identified critical path issues. To meet the projected demand, these solutions will involve doubling the capacity of the existing transformers. The proposed system will mitigate load imbalances and stabilize voltage fluctuations by effectively managing rapid variations in reactive power demand. As a result, it improves power quality for industrial consumers.</p>",

A time-dependent fully developed parabolic velocity profile is modeled into two phases of cardiac cycle. The hemodynamic properties are analyzed at peak of systole, a random point, and peak of diastole of cardiac cycle and the results are compared with non-pulsatile case. A pressure drops and acceleration of velocity due to high-velocity gradient leading a high wall shear at the stenosed region. The velocity was measured to 2.73 m/s for pulsatile flow at the peak of the systole and 1.15 m/s for non-pulsatile.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents unprecedented challenges in maintaining operational resilience, ensuring&nbsp;data privacy, and meeting regulatory compliance, particularly in distributed and mission-critical applications. This paper explores a robust IoT system architecture that leverages edge-cloud synergy to address these challenges. By integrating edge computing for local processing and cloud platforms for scalable storage and analytics, the proposed architecture enables uninterrupted operations during network disruptions and supports latency-sensitive tasks. Additionally, it enhances data sovereignty by enforcing privacy policies at the edge, reducing exposure of sensitive information to centralized servers. The framework also incorporates compliance-aware modules that adapt to dynamic regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Simulation and prototype evaluations demonstrate the architecture's effectiveness in sustaining operations during disconnections, reducing cloud dependency by over 40%, and maintaining strict privacy controls without compromising system performance. These findings establish edge-cloud synergy as a critical enabler for resilient, secure, and regulation-compliant IoT deployments in smart cities, healthcare, and industrial automation.</span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p>The Peripheral covered stent graft system is self-expanding device has a mesh like structure made with ePTFE material, which surrounds a flexible Nitinol stent frame. It combines a Nitinol stent framework&nbsp;with an expanded poly-tetra-flouro-ethylene (e-PTFE) covering and radiopaque Tantalum markers for&nbsp;enhanced visibility and deployment precision. The covered stent of this device helps reduce the risk of&nbsp;complications, such as re-stenosis and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Peripheral artery disease&nbsp;(PAD) is a common condition where the blood vessels in the legs get narrow or blocked. This can cause&nbsp;serious problems like poor blood flow, tissue damage, loss of limbs, or even death. While treatments like&nbsp;medications, angioplasty, and surgery work for many patients, some complex or hard-to-treat blockages&nbsp;need the use of Peripheral covered stent graft system. It is used to restore blood flow, stop more&nbsp;blockages, and sustained support for conditions like peripheral artery disease (PAD), aneurysms, and&nbsp;complicated blood vessel problems. This research article presents an in-vitro simulation test methodology<br>aimed at evaluating the performance, safety, and efficiency of this device. The in-vitro channel study&nbsp;replicated physiological environments to evaluate the device's performance prior to Pre-clinical &amp; clinical&nbsp;application. In-vitro channel study was developed to mimic the anatomical and hemodynamic&nbsp;environment of peripheral arteries. Artificial fatty deposits were created using polyurethane, and a salinebased blood analog was used to simulate physiological flow. The device was deployed under controlled&nbsp;conditions, and its performance was evaluated across multiple parameters, including deployment success,<br>interaction with the vessel wall, self-expansion efficiency, and restoration of blood flow. The in-vitro&nbsp;simulation validated the mechanical integrity, vascular apposition, and overall efficacy of the Peripheral&nbsp;Covered Stent Graft System in re-establishing vascular patency. While the results are promising, the&nbsp;absence of biological interaction highlights the need for further preclinical studies and chronic&nbsp;implantation evaluations to confirm long-term safety and effectiveness. These findings support the<br>device&rsquo;s readiness for clinical trials and its potential as a valuable intervention for treating PAD.&nbsp;</p>",

        "publication_date": "2025-09-01",
        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The survey was distributed in Chinese. The beginning of it included an introduction section followed by data processing agreement where the willing participants could indicate if they agree that the data is going to be processed in accordance with the Federal Law \u2116 152-FZ &ldquo;On Personal Data&rdquo; from 27.07.2006.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The content of the survey included 3 parts: qualitative open questions, followed by quantitative surveys, and at the end participants needed to report their demographics. They could choose not to reply to any of the scientific questions, but the demographics data was obligatory to report if the participants wanted to submit their answers. They were free to quit at any time.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The qualitative part was created by the first author and discussed with her supervisor at that time. The list of questions included the following:</span></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"\">\n<td style=\"width: 522.8pt; padding: 0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;\">\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q1: Please think and describe the difficulties and problems of studying at a Russian university.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q2: Please list what problems that were particularly difficult for you to cope with in the first six months of studying at a Russian university.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q3: Please think and write what helps you cope with these difficulties.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q4: Who helps you overcome difficulties (your classmates, teachers, dorm friends, etc.)? Please list.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q5: What advice could you give to a student just planning to come to study in Russia?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q6: What do you think would especially help him?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q7: Who could help him?</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this study, we used replies to questions Q1, Q2 and Q3.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">A more detailed description of some validated scales&rsquo; psychometric properties can be found in the published Supplements in </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Muzychenko &amp; Morozova, 2025)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. In this study, the scales (excluding education satisfaction and cross-cultural adjustment) weren&rsquo;t focal, thus, we didn&rsquo;t use CFA and rather computed average scores to give a brief idea about possible differences in personality quality between the clusters.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure the level of cross-cultural adaptation (CCA) in this study, we used the Sociocultural Adaptation Scale developed by J. Black and G. Stephens </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Black &amp; Stephens, 1989)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> and adapted by </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Ang et al., 2007)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Respondents were asked to express their level of agreement with statements using a 7-point Likert scale. Students were not time-restricted when completing the scale; they were asked to review each item and select the response that best matched their self-perception. The items on the scale were as follows: \"How well have you adjusted to your current situation in term of socializing with people?\", \"How well have you adjusted to interacting with people on day-to-day basis?\", \"How well have you adjusted to getting along with people?\" (1 &ndash; unadjusted, 7 &ndash; adjusted). In this study, we used this scale in Chinese, which was translated by a native speaker using back-translation procedures. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure psychological adaptation, this study assessed education satisfaction (EdS) as an aspect of psychological well-being related to the primary activity at the host location. The study utilized a scale adapted from the Job Satisfaction Survey by J. Hackman and G. Oldham </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, where respondents indicated their level of agreement with statements on a 5-point Likert scale. In this study, the scale was translated into Chinese using back-translation procedures by a native speaker: the original items were rephrased to pertain to the current academic setting abroad rather than to work (e.g., \" Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with my assignment.\"). Students were not time-restricted when completing the scale; they were asked to review each item and select the response that best matched their self-perception. The items on the scale were as follows: \" Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with my assignment\", \" I frequently think of quitting my assignment.\", \" I am generally satisfied with the kinds of work I am doing.\" (1 &ndash; strongly disagree, 5 &ndash; strongly agree).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure perceived stress during the last month, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> was used. <span>Chinese version, or Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, CPSS - 10 <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u65b0</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u534e\u4e66\u5e97\u5317\u7f8e\u7f51</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, 2017)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> was utilized. It includes 4 questions about self-efficacy and 6 about helplessness. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure emotional stability (ES), the author utilized the IPIP-50 scale </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Goldberg, 1992)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, where respondents rated their agreement with statements on a 5-point Likert scale. This instrument was adapted into Chinese by R.-H. Li and Y.-C. Chen </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Goldberg, 1992)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Students were not time-restricted when completing the scale; they were asked to review each item and select the response that most accurately reflected their self-perception. The statements in the scale were as follows: &ldquo;I have frequent mood swings&rdquo;, &ldquo;I change my mood a lot&rdquo;, &ldquo;I worry about things&rdquo;, &ldquo;I often feel blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;I seldom feel blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am easily disturbed&rdquo;, &ldquo;I get irritated easily&rdquo;, &ldquo;I get upset easily&rdquo;, &ldquo;I get stressed out easily&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am relaxed most of the time&rdquo; (1 - strongly disagree, 5 - strongly agree).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure sense of coherence (SOC), this study utilized the validated scale developed by A. Antonovsky </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Antonovsky, 1993)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, consisting of 13 items (responses rated from 1 to 7 on a semantic differential scale), adapted into Chinese by L.-P. Bao and J.-S. Liu </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Bao &amp; Liu, 2005)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Students were not time-restricted when completing the scale; they were asked to review each item and select the response that most accurately reflected their self-perception. Reverse coding was applied to items one, two, three, seven, and ten. The statements in the scale were as follows: \"Do you have the feeling that you really don't care about what is going on around you?\" (1 - very seldom or never, 7 - very often), \"Has it happened in the past that you were surprised by the behavior of people whom you thought you knew well? \" (1 - never happened, 7 - always happened), \"Has it happened that people whom you counted on disappointed you?\" (1 - never happened, 7 - always happened), \"Until now your life has had:\" (1 - no clear goals, 7 - very clear goals and purpose), \"Do you have the feeling that you are being treated unfairly?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never), \"Do you have the feeling that you are in an unfamiliar situation and don't know what to do?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never), \"Doing the things you do every day:\" (1 - a source of deep pleasure and satisfaction, 7 - a source of pain and boredom), \"Do you have very mixed-up feelings and ideas?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never), \"Does it happen that you experience feelings that you would rather not have to endure?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never), \"Many people, even with a strong character, sometimes feel 'lost.' I experience this state\" (1 - never, 7 - very often), \"When certain events occurred, have you generally found that?\" (1 - you overestimated or underestimated their importance, 7 - you assessed the situation correctly), \"How often do you have the feeling that there is little meaning in the things you do in your daily life?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never), \"How often do you have feelings that you are not sure you can control?\" (1 - very often, 7 - very seldom or never).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The translation version used in this dissertation has a good history of use in Chinese literature. It was initially adapted by Sun Yat-sen University and published in a book on quality of life measurement methods in 2000 by Peking University Medical Press. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The cross-cultural motivation (CCM) scale was adapted from </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Ang et al., 2007)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, where respondents indicated their level of agreement with statements on a 7-point Likert scale. The Chinese adaptation of the scale is freely available in </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Long, 2018)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Students were not time-restricted when completing the scale; they were asked to review each item and select the response that best matched their self-perception. The items on the scale were as follows: \"I enjoy interacting with people from different cultures.\", \"I am confident that I can socialize with locals in a culture that is unfamiliar to me.\", \"I am sure I can deal with the stress of adjusting to a culture that is new to me.\", \"I enjoy living in cultures that are unfamiliar to me.\", \" I am confident I can get accustomed to the shopping conditions in a different country\" (1 &ndash; very strongly disagree, 7 &ndash; very strongly agree).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The subjective socioeconomic status scale was recorded via \"MacArthur Ladder\" </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Adler et al., 2000)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> (Adler et al., 2000), adapted to Chinese by D.-Q. Ding and colleagues </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Ding et al., 2021)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Additionally, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) scale was used to measure Russian language proficiency </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Council of Europe, 2001)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. These items were treated as continuous since they had more than 5 levels, and therefore could be seen as continuous variables, taken into account the recent simulation studies </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Rhemtulla et al., 2012)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The students were also asked to report their biological gender, age in years, level of education, marital status, time spent enrolled in an educational program in Russia, the fact of attending cross-cultural trainings prior to the arrival, the fact of participating in academic exchange programs prior to studies in Russia.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure overall quality of life, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> was used. The Department of Social Medicine at Zhejiang University School of Medicine translated the SF-36 into Chinese in 1991, the translated content is freely available on the psychspace website </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Psychspace, 2011)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. SF-36 has different types of scales from 2-item (yes/no) to 6-item scales and the questions focus of the health and wellbeing during the last month, and this year in comparison to the previous year. During the data collection, some of the data was not stored due to technical issue, the amount still allows to run the analysis using multiple imputation, but for the purposes of this analysis, we treated them as separate items.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To measure altruism, Organizational Citizenship Behavior&rsquo;s subscale called &ldquo;Altruism towards colleagues&rdquo; (A) was used </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Farh et al., 2004)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The scale was translated to Chinese </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u5218\u5bb6\u56fd</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> et al., 2017)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. The version used in this study was back translated by a native speaker with a PhD degree in organizational behavior prior to the release of this publication with back-translation procedures. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Social desirability scale was also utilized, but not used in any analyses, because later in 2024 the first author found a meta-analysis on uselessness of this scale to measure social desirability, what was captured by experimental studies </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lanz et al., 2022)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. The scale used was the Short form of the Marlowe&ndash;Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS) translated into Chinese </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Tao et al., 2009)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The base set of scales (ES, SOC, EdS, CCA, CCM, A and demographics) underwent check along with a back-translation procedure following Brislin's guidelines </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Brislin, 1970)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. First, the first author modified the original items of the job satisfaction scale </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> to pertain to the current academic setting abroad rather than to work (e.g., \" Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with my assignment.\"). Next, an independent bilingual expert educated in business management translated the original English scales into Chinese (excl. A). Piloting of the subscales present in this study happened in 2019 on another sample of Chinese students at BMSTU</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Muzychenko, 2022a, 2022b; Muzychenko et al., 2019, 2022)</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. The first author additionally distributed the new set of scales (the base set, PSS-10, SF-36, SDS, </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">MacArthur Ladder</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">) among four native speakers before the research in 2024 to identify discrepancies and ensure cultural appropriateness, focusing on maintaining conceptual equivalence rather than literal translation. Later on, another bilingual expert, a specialist in Chinese hieroglyphics and a PhD student at the Department of Chinese Philology, was also invited to cross-validate the translation. </span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Echinococcosis is a disease caused by helminths that affects cattle, sometimes leading to weight loss and a reduction in production. The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of Echinococcosis and the associated risk factors in cattle slaughtered at the Man slaughterhouse. The study was carried out on 586 cattle consisting of females (424) and males (162). These animals were examined by post-mortem examination to demonstrate the presence of Echinococcosis by visual examination, incision and palpation of the organs according to the routine method used by veterinarians. The results showed a low prevalence of Echinococcosis in cattle (1.20%). The prevalence of this parasitosis was higher in males (3.1%) than in females (0.47%). In this study, the sex of the animal was a risk factor (p=0.009). As for age, no significant difference was observed (p &gt; 0.05) even if cattle aged 2 to 4 seem to be the most contaminated (1.7%), followed by those aged 4 (1.1%) and less than 2 years (0%). Despite this low prevalence, it would be necessary to search for the main sources of contamination of cattle for better control of Echinococcosis in the region. We recommend that veterinary authorities prohibit the dumping of contaminated organs from this slaughterhouse into the Ko River to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.</p>\n<p>published by the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://innspub.net/journal-of-biodiversity-and-environmental-sciences/\"><strong>Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences | JBES</strong></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",
