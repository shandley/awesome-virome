The method is described in the following paper, that you should cite in publications:\n> Mo\u00efra B Dion, Pier-Luc Plante, Edwige Zufferey, Shiraz A Shah, Jacques Corbeil, Sylvain Moineau, Streamlining CRISPR spacer-based bacterial host predictions to decipher the viral dark matter, *Nucleic Acids Research*, Volume 49, Issue 6, 6 April 2021, Pages 3127\u20133138, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab133\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nFirst, download or clone this repository. The easiest way is using `git clone https://github.com/plpla/CrisprOpenDB.git`.\n\nNext, we recommend to create a virtual environment to run the tool. You can set up a conda environment using the `conda_env.txt` file in the initial directory and the following command:\n```python\nconda create -c conda-forge --name CrisprOpenDB_env --file conda_env.txt\n```\n\nDon't forget to activate the environment to use it: `conda activate CrisprOpenDB_env`.\nYou can now install the tool: `python setup.py install`.\n\nTo use this program, you need to download the spacer database and the sqlite file (http://crispr.genome.ulaval.ca/dash/PhageHostIdentifier_DBfiles.zip) and unzip the files in the `CrisprOpenDB/SpacersDB/` directory. Note that files are quite large. The download size is about 800Mo for the compressed file. Once unzipped, file sizes will be approximately 600Mo for the spacer database and 3.8Go for the sqlite file. If you plan on using Blast to run the program, you need to build the blast database. Instructions for this optional step are at the end of this README file with instructions on how to install Blast if it not already installed on your computer.\n\nOnce these steps are complete, don't forget to go back to the initial directory to run the program. You can now try your installation with one of our test genome, as explained below.\n\n### Running\n\nTo run the program, you must launch the `CL_Interface.py` file in the working directory.\nHere is an example of how to run the program using a *Salmonella* phage genome and a number of mismatches of 2:\n```python\npython CL_Interface.py -i Salmonella_161.fasta -m 2\n```\n### Test genomes\n\nWe provide test genomes for each level of prediction in the `TestGenomes/` directory. These will allow you to make sure the tool has been properly set up before moving on with your personal analyses.\nThe commands you should use to perform the tests as well as the expected results are shown down below.\n\nLevel 1 prediction:\n```python\npython CL_Interface.py -i TestGenomes/KJ489400.fasta\n```\n`('KJ489400.1', 'Bacillus', 1)`\n\nLevel 2 prediction:\n```python\npython CL_Interface.py -i TestGenomes/AY133112.fasta\n```\n`('AY133112.1', 'Vibrio', 2)`\n\nLevel 3 prediction:\n```python\npython CL_Interface.py -i TestGenomes/MT074469.fasta\n```\n`('MT074469.1', 'Salmonella', 3)`\n\nLevel 4 prediction (note that level 4 predictions do not return a genus):\n```python\npython CL_Interface.py -i TestGenomes/MT074470.fasta\n```\n`('MT074470.1', 'Enterobacterales', 4)`\n\n### Options and additional information for installation\n\nAlignment can be done using `blastn` or `fasta36`. To install Blast inside the Anaconda environment run:\n```\nconda activate CrisprOpenDB_env\nconda install -c bioconda blast\n```\n\nIf using BLAST, you also need to use `makeblastdb` before running the phage host identification tool. Here is the command line you should use when running `makeblastdb` from the `CrisprOpenDB/SpacersDB/` directory:\n```\nmakeblastdb -in SpacersDB.fasta -dbtype nucl -out SpacersDB\n```\nIf you wish, you can also provide your own BLAST or FASTA database to perform the alignment.\n\nIf you would like to manually further explore a prediction, you can use the `-t, --table` option. This will send the table containing both blast results and spacers information extracted from the spacers database to an external CSV file. Since one file per phage genome is issued, we recommend that you do not use this option when first running the tool (especially with large datasets), but rather use it afterwards if you need further information on a specific genome.\n\n"
