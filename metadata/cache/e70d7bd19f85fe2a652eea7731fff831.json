VirusTaxo has an average accuracy of 93% at genus level prediction in DNA and RNA viruses. VirusTaxo outperformed existing taxonomic classifiers of viruses where it assigned taxonomy of a larger fraction of metagenomic contigs compared to other methods. Benchmarking of VirusTaxo on a collection of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing libraries and metavirome datasets suggests that VirusTaxo can characterize virus taxonomy from highly diverse contigs and provide a reliable decision on the taxonomy of viruses.\n\n\n## Quickstart\n### Add VirusTaxo in LatchBio\n1. Log into https://latch.bio.\n2. Find **VirusTaxo** within **Workflows > All Workflows** tab or, go here [https://console.latch.bio/explore/63583/info](https://console.latch.bio/explore/63583/info).\n3. Add VirusTaxo to your workspace (There's a button for it)\n4. You will find VirusTaxo in **My Workflows** tab and click on it.\n5. Now you can run prediction analysis\n\n### Provide Input and Run\n1. Provide input `fasta` file. You can upload `fasta` file containing viral (single or multiple) sequences. Or, you can use test input data containing 1,553 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences provided by us. [Download from here](https://mega.nz/file/JhAC0BRA#P1wQoYjj5mVscI-l8ADN_H723a_q2Jp4ISKpxPtGPwY).\n2. Select Genome Type as **RNA** since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.\n   <br/>\n   *Note: If you do not know what the genome type is, select **Unknown** option. In case of DNA viruses, select **DNA**.*\n3. Launch the workflow.\n\n\n## Input Options\n- `Input Fasta File`: Provide concatenated viral sequences in a single fasta file.\n- `Virus Genome Type`: For DNA viruses, set this to `DNA`. For RNA viruses, set this to `RNA`. If the fasta file contains both DNA and RNA viral sequences, then selecting `Unknown` genome type will predict the taxonomy of both DNA and RNA viruses.\n\n\n## How to cite\n- Paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110414\n\n\n## Links:\n- VirusTaxo Tool: https://console.latch.bio/explore/63583/info\n- Website: https://omics-lab.com/virustaxo\n- Paper Code: https://github.com/omics-lab/VirusTaxo\n- Workflow Source Code: https://github.com/nahid18/virustaxo-wf\n\n\n## FAQ\n**Q:** Can I use `fastq` files?\n<br/>\n**A:** No, you cannot. But you can assemble the `fastq` reads using [Megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit). Then use the Megahit contigs (in `fasta` format) in VirusTaxo.\n"
