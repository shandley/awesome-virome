It also produces dynamic annotated \u201cprophage genome maps\u201d and marks possible transposon insertion spots inside prophages. It is applicable for mining prophage regions from large metagenomic datasets.\n\n## Updates tracker\nYou can find the information about updates and releases by [link.](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro/blob/master/version_tracker.md)\n\n## Documentation: Installation & Usage\nPlease, follow [the documentation link](https://phigaro.readthedocs.io/) to find installation and usage information.\n\n## Methods overview\nOpen-reading frames (i.e. proteins) are predicted from the input FASTA file using Prodigal. Phage genes are annotated with prokaryotic viral orthologous groups (pVOGs) profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which can be downloaded stand-alone from http://dmk-brain.ecn.uiowa.edu/pVOGs/. Each contig is represented as a sequence of phage and non-phage genes. A smoothing window algorithm (a triangular window function) determines regions with a high density of phage genes and therefore the prophage regions and boundaries, considering the pVOG annotations and the GC content.\n\n## Known issues\nPhigaro is tested on Linux systems. For MacOS, you may need to add the following softlink `ln -s /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb /usr/local/bin/updated` and run `brew install wget`. If you encounter any issues while running Phigaro on test data, please report them to us at estarikova@rcpcm.org.\n\n## Publication\nElizaveta V. Starikova, Polina O. Tikhonova, Nikita A.
