        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the processes of development, implementation and effective functioning of adaptive models of strategic management in the field of development activities focused on construction in a volatile economic environment. The core of the analysis is the organizational and economic decision&ndash;making structure that enables development companies to ensure flexibility, proactivity and strategic consistency of their actions in response to the challenges of macroeconomic volatility, fluctuations in resource prices, changes in real estate demand and regulatory transformations. Particular attention is paid to the institutional components of management, modular strategy design, dynamic forecasting of market scenarios and digital support for decision&ndash;making. The economic effects of implementing adaptive models at different stages of the development project life cycle &mdash; from pre&ndash;project analysis to facility operation &mdash; are also studied. The approach under analysis is based on a synthesis of strategic management, risk&ndash;oriented planning, project analysis and digital management tools, which makes it possible to systematically form competitive advantages in conditions of market turbulence.<br>The purpose of the article is to form a theoretical and applied concept of adaptive strategic management of development construction projects, which allows to respond promptly to dynamic changes in the external environment, minimize strategic risks and ensure long&ndash;term economic sustainability. The focus is on building a management model capable of integrating market analysis, resource forecasting, risk monitoring and stakeholder coordination into a single decision&ndash;making platform. The results are aimed at increasing the adaptability of the developer to cyclical and crisis economic fluctuations.<br>The methodology of the study is based on a systemic interdisciplinary approach that combines methods of strategic management, adaptive planning, economic and mathematical modeling and digital transformation of management processes. At the first stage, situational analysis methods were applied to identify key triggers of destabilization of development project strategies in a volatile economic environment. Then, using the SWOT analysis toolkit, the strengths of existing approaches to strategic management were outlined and areas of strategic vulnerability were identified. To build the adaptive model, the Balanced Scorecard approach combined with KPI metrics was used, which makes it possible to create a flexible system for monitoring the implementation of strategic goals. Scenario planning, digital risk simulation, and the construction of a tree of strategic decisions with options for responding to external economic changes were used as modeling methods. In addition, the study used case analysis of strategic management practices of development companies that successfully implement adaptive strategies in the Ukrainian and European markets. The stakeholder mapping method plays a special role, which was used to build a communication network and reduce management risks through transparent distribution of responsibilities and predictable feedback. All methods are combined into a general analytical model that allows to assess the effectiveness of adaptive strategies in conditions of turbulence and transformational challenges.<br>Research Results. The result of the work is the formation of an adaptive model of strategic management based on the combination of economic forecasting, flexible management decisions and multilevel risk analysis. The proposed model allows development companies to respond not only to predictable changes, but also to unexpected shocks, while maintaining strategic consistency and operational flexibility. The use of digital KPI dashboards has reduced the time lag between the emergence of a threat and the adoption of corrective decisions. A typology of adaptation scenarios has been developed, which includes both proactive (for example, changing the housing format in accordance with market expectations) and reactive ones (changes in construction schedules, revision of pricing policy). It was found that involving stakeholders at the early stages of strategic planning increases the level of interest alignment, reduces the risks of conflicts and contributes to the formation of a stable institutional environment around the project. Practical testing of the model on examples of Ukrainian developers showed an increase in financial performance by 18&ndash;22% compared to companies using static management strategies. Thus, the proposed model proves its effectiveness both economically and organizationally.<br>Conclusion. Adaptive strategic management is a key prerequisite for the successful implementation of development construction projects in conditions of economic dynamics. The results of the study confirm that classical models of strategic planning, built on assumptions of environmental stability, no longer meet modern realities and need to be rethought in favor of flexibility, speed and scenario thinking. The adaptive management model proposed in the work allows for systematic risk assessment, identification of areas of strategic uncertainty, forecasting the effects of external changes and accordingly adjusting the internal decision&ndash;making structure. An important conclusion is that digitalization and simulation forecasting not only accelerate management cycles, but become the basis for building project analytics that allows to form competitive advantages in real time. It is determined that the most effective are those companies that integrate adaptive models into strategic planning already at the pre&ndash;investment stage, forming a management architecture as a feedback system. Stakeholder involvement should not be declarative, but structured &mdash; with clearly defined roles, access to analytics and tools to influence risk&ndash;related decisions. Thus, adaptive models can become not only a means of crisis response, but also a platform for long&ndash;term resilience and economic growth of the development business in conditions of constant challenges.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This study focuses on the issue of uneven deployment of edge computing nodes in 5G networks. A multi-regional simulation model was constructed, and four key performance indicators were evaluated: average end-to-end latency, node load balance, request success rate, and resource utilization. Various optimization techniques, including automated scheduling and network slicing, were employed to control the simulation. The simulation results show that the average latency decreased from 54.8ms to 35.9ms, the load balance increased to 0.72, the request success rate rose to 91.7%, and the resource utilization improved to 74.6%. The study demonstrates that deploying optimized control strategies can significantly alleviate the performance bottleneck caused by uneven node distribution, thereby enhancing the overall service capability and resource utilization of the edge computing system.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This study investigated the competencies of Scene of the Crime Operatives (SOCO) investigators within the Eastern Police District Forensic Unit (EPDFU) in Metro Manila, Philippines. It developed a framework for best practices in forensic investigation. Recognizing the growing complexity of crime scene investigations and the evolving role of forensic science, this research assesses investigators&rsquo; technical capabilities, adherence to protocols, and access to forensic resources and tools. A concurrent mixed-methods design was employed, integrating quantitative data from Individual Performance Evaluation Ratings (IPER) and competency assessments with qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews to explore operational challenges. Findings reveal significant disparities in resource availability, with many investigators lacking access to modern forensic equipment and advanced training. While competencies in basic crime scene procedures were generally adequate, gaps persisted in areas requiring advanced forensic knowledge and inter-agency coordination. The study established a strong correlation between resource adequacy and investigator performance, highlighting the systemic impact of logistical and procedural limitations on evidence handling and crime resolution. This research contributes to the criminology literature by contextualizing global forensic standards within local constraints, offering a practical framework for modernizing forensic operations. It underscores the importance of equipping investigators with both skills and tools to ensure credible, efficient, and timely crime scene investigations&mdash;ultimately reinforcing public trust and judicial integrity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)&mdash;primarily generative AI&mdash;into nursing education represents a significant shift in the way student nurses learn. In this narrative review, we summarize where ChatGPT, a complex AI language model created by OpenAI, sits in nursing education today. In fact, ChatGPT in education is growing, and is being used more often to enhance students learning processes. This AI chatbot generates text that would be similar to the course of a human conversation. It provides personalized tutoring, addresses challenging questions and helps with mock case studies. However, ChatGPT integration to nursing education faces some barriers. With constantly changing things, ChatGPT's information can be inconsistent. There is a constant need for updates (which keep pace with current standards) and one fear is that human interaction will be less frequent. Ethical problems on its use and place in complex educational content also is discussed along with the need for overall supervision. Overall, the review highlights that ChatGPT has great potential for improving nursing education; however, it must be carefully planned for and monitored to the extent possible. Much more needs to be done to know how ChatGPT shapes nursing education. Integration of ChatGPT into nursing education has benefits in terms of ease of use, personal learning and clinical reasoning. This AI tool complements the educators in providing more support, promotes interdepartmental collaboration, and helps educators overcome resource constraint through scalable and low cost AI tool. As nursing education continues to evolve, responsible integration of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will become essential in progress and also improved patient outcomes associated with nursing education.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Purpose.</strong>&nbsp;To analyze the growth characteristics of six varieties of&nbsp;basket willow plantations over eight years of cultivation in the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. Establish the optimal age for harvesting biomass.&nbsp;<strong>Methods.</strong>&nbsp;Field, laboratory, analytical and statistical.&nbsp;<strong>Results.</strong>&nbsp;Biometric studies of eight-year-old shoots from plantations revealed differences in their height, diameter, and weight. The cultivar &lsquo;Inger&rsquo; had the highest values: 6.42 m, 3.3 cm, and 1.76 kg, respectively. The values were slightly lower for &lsquo;Tordis&rsquo;: 6.25 m, 3.1 cm, and 1.67 kg. The heights of the other varieties ranged from 5.90 m (&lsquo;Warm-maz&rsquo;) to 6.13 m (&lsquo;Wilhelm&rsquo;), the diameters ranged from 1.85 cm (&lsquo;Gigantea&rsquo;) to 2.55 cm (&lsquo;Marzencinski&rsquo;), and the dry weights of the shoots ranged from 0.89 kg (&lsquo;Gigantea&rsquo;) to 1.05 kg (&lsquo;Marzencinski&rsquo;). Dry biomass productivity ranged from 9.55 t/ha (&lsquo;Gigantea&rsquo;) to 36.9 t/ha (&lsquo;Inger&rsquo;). A significant decrease in annual height growth was observed in all the studied cultivars: after five years in &lsquo;Tordis&rsquo;, after four years in &lsquo;Wilhelm&rsquo;, &lsquo;Inger&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gigantea&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Marzencinski&rsquo;, and after three years in &lsquo;Warm-maz&rsquo;. A significant decrease in diameter growth was observed after five years in &lsquo;Wilhelm&rsquo;, after three years in &lsquo;Tordis&rsquo;, and after four years in the rest.&nbsp;<strong>Conclusions.</strong> The first harvesting of biomass from the studied plantations should be carried out at the age of four years, and the subsequent harvesting at the age of three or two years.</p>",

Under this framework, promoting the coordinated evolution of higher education clusters has become a strategic supporting factor for regional development. The cultivation of international higher education clusters not only provides high-end intellectual resources and compound talent reserves for the construction of Greater Bay Area's science and technology innovation hub, but also creates a historic opportunity for universities in the region to break down barriers and deepen collaborative innovation mechanisms. By strengthening the strategic consensus of higher education cluster development, optimizing resource allocation and spatial layout, systematically exploring the coordinated development path of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area's higher education clusters, and then building an international higher education network system with distinct levels, gradient connection and close interaction, it will become an important engine driving the high-quality development of the world-class bay area.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In Asia, the most frequent cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is<br>chronic hepatitis B. The hepatitis B virus's (HBV) genomic integration is<br>probably a precursor to carcinogenesis. The integrated HBV genome may<br>directly activate nearby cellular genes to give the liver cells a selective growth<br>advantage. Our study's goal was to determine if genetic variants in 11&beta;-HSD1,<br>rs846910 and rs12086634 could be linked to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)<br>infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 150 samples were collected<br>from people suffering from hepatitis B with HCC, HCC, and healthy people.<br>The samples were genotyped for 11&beta; HSD1 (rs846910 and rs12086634) using<br>allele-specific real-time PCR. After performing genotyping of the 11&beta;-HSD1<br>gene using real-time PCR, both alleles G and A of rs846910 were found to be<br>more prevalent in the two groups of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis B.<br>This gives a clear indication about the possibility of contracting hepatocellular<br>carcinoma and hepatitis B. A different result was found than previously, as the<br>TT genotype of rs12086634 showed a protective effect against hepatocellular<br>carcinoma and hepatitis B virus infection, while the AG genotype of rs846910<br>increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. These genetic variations are<br>clearly significant biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Confidential computing is a paradigm designed to protect data not only at rest and in transit but also during active processing. While traditionally associated with cloud environments, where it enables secure deployment of computing workloads for improved performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency, its applications are expanding into other domains.</p>\n<p>This document explores the applicability of confidential computing technologies in resource-constrained embedded systems, evaluating both software-based approaches (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) and hardware-based solutions (Trusted Execution Environments). A short overview of confidential computing enablers, especially for ARM and RISC-V platforms, is given.</p>\n<p>Key use cases are presented, particularly in secure edge computing, where latency constraints, limited bandwidth, or large data volumes require local processing at the edge or along the edge-cloud continuum. In embedded systems, code confidentiality can be as critical as data confidentiality, especially when proprietary algorithms are deployed in physically insecure or even hostile environments. The study also highlights confidential computing use cases across verticals such as automotive, healthcare, military, and financial services, emphasizing the unique security requirements of each.</p>\n<p>While cloud-based confidential computing often relies on confidential virtual machines for ease of deployment, embedded systems typically adopt a lighter-weight protected application/process model that demands more customization but fits within tighter resource constraints.</p>\n<p>The document also details experimental work with Keystone enclaves on the RISC-V platform, including methods for deploying encrypted native code workloads or running lightweight runtimes for Python or WebAssembly with optional encryption support. Although Fully Homomorphic Encryption remains computationally intensive for embedded devices, the report explores hybrid models where client-side operations are performed locally and offloaded to cloud services for secure computation. Benchmark results for client-side operations and the Homomorphic WiSARDs framework are also included.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN\">Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that remains a significant global health issue, claiming nearly 4 million lives each year. One of the most concerning pathogens in this context is Acinetobacter baumannii, which has gained notoriety as a multidrug-resistant organism. This bacterium is often associated with pneumonia acquired in hospitals and those linked to ventilators. The patterns of resistance it exhibits complicate treatment options, underscoring the urgent need for new therapies to enhance patient outcomes. One exciting possibility is Zosurabalpin, a groundbreaking experimental antibiotic currently being studied. This first-of-its-kind drug is part of the macrolide-derived antimicrobial family and works through a distinctive mechanism. It specifically targets the LptB2FGC complex, a protein system that helps transport lipopolysaccharide across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. By blocking this transport pathway, Zosurabalpin disrupts membrane formation and leads to bacterial death. Its bactericidal effects are particularly potent against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, a pathogen for which treatment options are limited. From a pharmacological standpoint, Zosurabalpin shows promising safety and tolerability in both preclinical and early clinical trials. While mild elevations in liver enzymes have been noted, which suggests the need for monitoring liver function, it&rsquo;s also important to assess renal function in patients with reduced clearance. The most frequently reported side effects include gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but the drug appears to have minimal effects on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Its pharmacokinetic profile indicates that it is administered intravenously, metabolized in the liver, and excreted through the kidneys.</span></p>",
