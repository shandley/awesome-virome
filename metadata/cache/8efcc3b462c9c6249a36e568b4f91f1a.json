The key\nfeatures are:\n\n-   Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x\n    speed of BLAST.\n-   [Protein clustering of up to tens of billions of proteins](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/wiki/Clustering)\n-   Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.\n-   Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard\n    desktops or laptops.\n-   Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML,\n    as well as taxonomic classification.\n\n[![Build](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)\n[![image](https://img.shields.io/cirrus/github/bbuchfink/diamond)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/bbuchfink/diamond/master)\n[![image](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bbuchfink/diamond/total)](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases)\n[![image](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond)\n[![image](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond/badges/downloads.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond)\n[![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbbuchfink%2Fdiamond-data%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fcitations.json&query=%24.citations&style=flat&label=Citations&color=%23a020f0\n)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kjPIF1cAAAAJ)\n    \nDocumentation\n=============\nThe online documentation is located at the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/wiki).\n\nSupport\n=======\nDIAMOND is actively supported and developed software. Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/issues) for malfunctions and the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/discussions) for questions, comments, feature requests, etc.\n\nAbout\n=====\nDIAMOND is developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Max Planck Institute for Biology\nT\u00fcbingen in collaboration with the Drost lab at the University of Dundee. From 2019-2024,\nit was developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Drost lab, Max Planck Institute for Biology\nT\u00fcbingen. From 2018-2019, its development was supported by the German Federal Ministry\nfor Economic Affairs and Energy through an EXIST grant. From 2016-2018, it was developed\nby Benjamin Buchfink as an independent researcher. From 2013-2015, the initial version\nwas developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Huson lab, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n\n\\[[:email:Email](mailto:buchfink@gmail.com)\\]\n\\[[X](https://x.com/bbuchfink)\\]\n\\[[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bbuchfink.bsky.social)\\]\n\\[[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-buchfink-875692105/)\\]\n\\[[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=kjPIF1cAAAAJ)\\]\n\\[[Drost lab](https://drostlab.com/)\\]\n\\[[MPI-BIO](https://www.bio.mpg.de/)\\]\n\n**When using the tool in published research, please cite:**\n\n-   Buchfink B, Reuter K, Drost HG, \\\"Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life\n    scale using DIAMOND\\\", *Nature Methods* **18**, 366\u2013368 (2021).\n    [doi:10.1038/s41592-021-01101-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01101-x)\n\nFor sequence clustering:\n\n-   Buchfink B, Ashkenazy H, Reuter K, Kennedy JA, Drost HG, \\\"Sensitive clustering\n    of protein sequences at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND DeepClust\\\", *bioRxiv*\n    2023.01.24.525373; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.24.525373 \n\nOriginal publication to cite DIAMOND until v0.9.25:\n\n-   Buchfink B, Xie C, Huson DH, \\\"Fast and sensitive protein alignment\n    using DIAMOND\\\", *Nature Methods* **12**, 59-60 (2015).\n    [doi:10.1038/nmeth.3176](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3176)\n"
