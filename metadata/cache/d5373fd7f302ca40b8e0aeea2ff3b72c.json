The program uses a binomial distribution to determine the probability that each variant is due to a known sequencing error rate. Filtering variants based on this value improves upon the common practice of using an arbitrary, fixed minor allele frequency cutoff (e.g., 2%). Additionally, VCFgenie implements arbitrarily complex filtering rules based on any keys in the `INFO` or `sample` columns.\n\nThe program is executed at the Unix command line or Mac Terminal as follows:\r\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --error_rate=0.0001 --VCF_files=example.vcf\r\n\r\nFind specific [examples](#examples) below. \n\n## <a name=\"contents\"></a>Contents\r\n\r\n* [Description](#description)\r\n* [How it Works](#how-it-works)\n* [Binomial Method](#binomial-method)\n* [Allele Processing Rules](#allele-processing-rules)\r\n* [Options](#options)\r\n* [Examples](#examples)\r\n* [Output](#output)\n* [TODO](#todo)\r\n* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\r\n* [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\r\n* [Citation](#citation)\r\n* [Contact](#contact)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"description\"></a>Description\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf\">**Variant Call Format (VCF)** files</a> are widely used to store genetic variant data. These data may summarize either **(1) individual-based sequencing data**, wherein one sequencing experiment corresponds to *one* individual (any ploidy); or **(2) pooled-sequencing data**, wherein one sequencing experiment corresponds to genetic material from *multiple* individuals (any ploidy) representing a population under study. Common examples of pooled-sequencing data include somatic tissues containing populations of tumor cells; samples combining known quantities of genetic material from multiple genotypes; and within-host populations of pathogen genomes such as viruses.\n\nVCF files are the result of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 'calling', for which numerous tools exist, including Freebayes, Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK), Ion Proton Variant Caller (TVC), Intrahost Variant Analysis of Replicates (iVar), LowFreq, Samtools mpileup, and VarScan 2.\n\nAfter SNP calling, various tools and libraries also exist for downstream analysis and filtering of VCF files. However, current options are designed for filtering but not modifying VCF records; use a predefined set of filtering options; treat reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) alleles inconsistently; or do not provide options for handling sites that are multiallelic (i.e., more than one ALT allele).\n\nVCFgenie allows the user to implement arbitrarily complex rules to both filter and modify records; handle failing REF and multiple ALT alleles consistently; and control for false-positives in a way that is reproducible (i.e., no custom code needed). Such steps are critical for conducting downstream (e.g., evolutionary and population genetic) analyses that rely on high-confidence polymorphism data.\n\n## <a name=\"how-it-works\"></a>How it Works\nVCFgenie is written in Python 3.8. Its dependencies include the following libraries, which the user may need to install (e.g., using `pip` or `conda`):\n\n* `argparse`\n* `collections`\n* `numpy`\n* `operator`\n* `os`\n* `re`\n* `scipy`\n* `sys`\n* `typing`\n* `vcf` (`pyvcf`)\n\nThe program examines one or more user-provided VCF files to filter, process, and modify records based on an arbitrarily complex set of user-provided rules. One record corresponds to one line of the VCF file, which reports a miniumum of two alleles: REF and ALT. Arbitrarily large numbers of ALT alleles (i.e., MULTIALLELIC sites) are allowed. \n\nAt present, VCFgenie explicitly examines the first sample reported in each VCF file, i.e., the sample reported in column 10 (with data keys provided in column 9, FORMAT). Because VCF file conventions differ widely, VCFgenie allows the user to specify which FORMAT data keys should be used to determine allele frequencies:\n\n1. `allele count`: the number of reads matching the ALT allele(s) (**DEFAULT**: `AC`)\n2. `allele frequency`: the frequency of the ALT allele(s) (**DEFAULT**: `AF`)\n3. `read depth (coverage)`: the total number of reads mapped to the site (**DEFAULT**: `DP`)\n\nTo determine allele frequencies and coverage, VCFgenie currently analyzes `AC`, `AF`, and `DP` (coverage) based on the `sample` data (column 10), not the `INFO` data (column 8). Many VCF files contain only one sample, in which case this will be sufficient. However, if the user wishes to analyze multiple samples that have been summarized in the same file (i.e., after column 10), it is currently necessary to create a separate VCF file for each sample to be analyzed, with that sample present in column 10.\n\nAdditional user-provided filtering criteria may be specified using any key/value pairs present in the `INFO` or `FORMAT`/`sample` columns, described in [Options](#options). Both REF and ALT alleles can fail if they do not meet a criterion, and both can fail multiple criteria. Summary statistics reported in the output may therefore include redundant data, e.g., the same allele may be classified as `failAF` and `failDP` (see [Allele Processing Rules](allele-processing-rules)).\n\nFuture instantiations of VCFgenie will allow (1) analysis based on `AC`/`AF`/`DP` data from the INFO column; and (2) automatic analysis of multiple samples, i.e., columns 10 and above.\n\n## <a name=\"binomial-method\"></a>Binomial Method\n\nIn addition to simple filtering rules, VCFgenie implements a dynamic (variant-by-variant) binomial test based on the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/chasewnelson/SARS-CoV-2-ORF3d#figure-8\">filter_VCF.py</a> script described by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/59633\">Nelson et al. (2020)</a>.\n\nThe method is **dynamic** because each variant is evaluated separately, with results depending on that site's `DP` and the variant's `AC`. The method is **binomial** because, given a sequencing error rate per base (`p`) and a site's coverage (`DP`), it determines the probability that each allele's `AC` (`x`) could have resulted from sequencing error alone. This allows the user limit the number of **false-positive calls** by rejecting any variants that are likely due to error.\n\nEach variant is tested using a binomial distribution based on the following parameters (see [Options](#options)):\n\n1. `DP`: the number of trials (*n*) for the distribution. This is set to the read depth (coverage) at the site (i.e., each **read** is an opportunity for error). The data key used can be customized using `--DP_key`.\n2. `error_rate`: the probability of 'success' (*p*) for the distribution, where success corresponds to a sequencing error. This value is supplied by the user with the `--error_rate` argument, which should correspond to the total error rate per base sequenced expected as the result of sample preparation, library preparation, and sequencing (currently assumes all nucleotide errors equally probable; see [TODO](#todo)).\n\nThe binomial calculation uses the `scipy.stats` function `binom.cdf`:\n\n\tbinom.cdf(x, n, p)\n\nwhere:\n\n\tn = read depth (coverage)\n\tp = error rate / 3\n\tx = allele count (number of ALT reads)\n\nThus, the method assumes a single nucleotide variant (SNV) model in which all three possible nucleotide errors occur at the same rate. Future instantiations of VCFgenie will allow more complex error models to be specified.\n\nThis binomial distribution is used to test the following hypotheses:\n\n\tH0 (null hypothesis): the SNV is due to error\n\tHA (alternative hypothesis): the SNV is a true variant\n\nThe p-value of a single nucleotide variant (SNV) with allele count **AC** is determined as:\n\n\tp-value = P(X \u2265 AC) = 1 - binom.cdf(AC - 1, n, p)\n\t\nIn other words, the p-value is the probability \u2014 given an SNV `error_rate` \u2014 that `AC` or more reads result from sequencing error. If this value is very low, the explanation of sequencing error is rejected, and the SNV is accepted as legitimate. \n\nBy default, VCFgenie simply reports the p-values for the reference allele (`PVR`) and alternative allele(s) (`PVA`) in the `INFO` and `FORMAT/sample` columns, where they may be used in downstream analysis. However, the user may also supply a **p-value cutoff** (`--p_cutoff`) to eliminate alleles with a p-value equal to or greater than the given value. For example, to implement a Bonferroni cutoff for the analysis of 987 variants with a significance level of 0.05, one could specify `--p_cutoff=0.0000507` (0.05/987).\n\nNote that the advantage of using the dynamic binomial method is that it precludes the need for a fixed, arbitrary `AF` cutoff (although one may still be applied using `--min_AF`).\n\n## <a name=\"allele-processing-rules\"></a>Allele Processing Rules\n\nResolution of failing alleles requires careful consideration. VCFgenie always maintains the same `DP` (coverage) at a site before and after processing and filtering. However, allele counts (`AC`) may be reassigned to different alleles, depending on which alleles pass the filtering criteria.\n\nThe following filtering rules are tested:\n\n1. `failZeroAC`: allele fails when 0 reads support it (REF or ALT). Typically occurs when no alleles match the reference sequence, or all ALT alleles have been eliminated by quality filters\n2. `failDP`: minimum read depth (coverage) fails `--min_DP`\n3. `failAC`: minimum allele count (REF or ALT) fails `--min_AC`\n4. `failMinAF`: minimum allele frequency (REF or ALT) fails `--min_AF`\n5. `failMaxAF`: maximum allele frequency (REF or ALT) fails `--max_AF`\n6. `failINFO`: fails one or more of the user-provided `--INFO_rules`\n7. `failsample`: fails one or more of the user-provided `--sample_rules`\n8. `failp`: variant's p-value fails `--p_cutoff`\n\nWhen appropriate, the following data will be added to the `INFO` column:\n\n1. `DECISION`=(`fixedREF` | `fixedALT` | `fail` | `failZeroAC` | `failDP` | `failAC` | `failAF` | `failINFO` | `failsample` | `failp` | `pass`): arbitrarily many flags may be added, because each allele (including REF) may fail multiple criteria\n2. `STATUS`=(`PASS` | `FAIL`): indicates whether each ALT allele passed; one flag per ALT allele will be added\n3. `fixedREF` **[Flag]**: site is fixed for the REF allele (100% reference)\n4. `fixedALT` **[Flag]**: site is fixed for a particular ALT allele (100% non-reference)\n5. `MULTIALLELIC` **[Flag]**: site is multiallelic (more than one ALT allele)\n6. `REF_FAIL` **[Flag]**: REF allele failed to pass criteria\n\nFor a site with one or more failing alleles, **one flag per allele** (including REF) will be reported in the `FILTER` column (semicolon-separated). This will include `PASS` for any passing alleles. Distinct values will be reported only once, in alphabetical order (i.e., order is not meaningful). Thus, a site that has a REF that passes and one ALT that fails will have a minimum of two flags: one for the REF and at least one for the ALT (e.g., `PASS;failAC`).\n\nThe reads corresponding to a failing allele (REF or ALT) are assumed to represent sequencing error. Thus, when an allele fails, its reads are given (re-assigned) to the allele(s) that passes.\n\n**In most contexts,** the majority of polymorphic sites are **biallelic** (one REF and one ALT allele) and the REF is the major allele. In such cases, if the ALT allele fails, the ALT reads will be assumed as sequencing error, and will be re-assigned to the REF (i.e., the REF allele will be fixed at 100%). Complementarily, at a biallelic site where the ALT is the major allele and the REF fails, the REF reads will be reassigned to the ALT (i.e., the ALT allele will be fixed at 100%).\n\n**Other rare instances** may occur, especially with pooled-sequencing data involving poorly-supported REF alleles and multiallelic sites. Methods of application and resolution are listed below:\n\n1. If an entire site fails (e.g., due to insufficient coverage), or if all alleles (including REF) fail at that site, all reads are given to the **major** (most common) allele, whether REF or ALT. (Future instantiations of VCFgenie will allow the user to re-assign them to the REF instead.)\n2. After all alleles are evaluated, reads from failing allele(s) are distributed to the passing allele(s) in proportion to each passing allele's frequency among all passing reads.\n3. If a key supplied in `--INFO_rules` or `--sample_rules` has `Number=A`, then there is one value per ALT allele, and the rule is evaluated separately for each ALT (REF lacks data so cannot be evaluated).\n4. If a key supplied in `--INFO_rules` or `--sample_rules` has `Number=1`, then there is one value for the site, and the rule is applied equally to all alleles (REF and ALT).\n5. Any flags other than `PASS` that are present in the `FILTER` column of the original VCF input will be mainained (carried over) to the filtered file.\n6. `NOCALL`: `PASS` is converted to `NOCALL` at sites where a major allele fails. In other words, this flag is added to any site at which the most common allele fails, and any `PASS` flags from previous passing (minor) alleles are removed.\n7. It is possible for a **minor allele to pass while a major allele fails**, e.g., when a `--sample_rule` causes an ALT but not the REF allele to fail and ALT is the major (most common) allele (recall that only ALT alleles have data specified for attributes with `Number=A`). In such cases, **no** `AF` **corrections are performed**; `AC` and `AF` are left as they were prior to evaluation, and passing alleles are converted to `NOCALL`.\n\n## <a name=\"options\"></a>Options\nCall VCFgenie using the following options: \n\n**REQUIRED:**\n\n* `-i`, `--VCF_files` **[FILE(S)]**: input VCF (variant call format) file(s)\n* `-e`, `--error_rate` **[float]**: sequencing error rate for single nucleotide substitutions per base sequenced; this should represent the total error rate expected as a result of the cumulative effects of sample preparation, library preparation, and sequencing (currently assumes all nucleotide errors equally probable). Future instantiations of VCFgenie will allow more complex error models\n\n**OPTIONAL:**\n\n* `-o`, `--out_dir` **[DIR]**: output directory name (**DEFAULT**: `VCFgenie_output`)\n* `-p`, `--p_cutoff` **[float]**: p-value cutoff ((**DEFAULT**: `1.0`)\n* `-c`, `--AC_key` **[str]**: FORMAT key to use for obtaining ALT allele count (**DEFAULT**: `AC`)\n* `-C`, `--AC_key_new` **[str]**: FORMAT key to use for new (filtered) ALT allele count (**DEFAULT**: `NAC`)\n* `-a`, `--AF_key` **[str]**: FORMAT key to use for obtaining ALT allele frequency (**DEFAULT**: `AF`)\n* `-A`, `--AF_key_new` **[str]**: FORMAT key to use for new (filtered) ALT allele frequency (**DEFAULT**: `NAF`)\n* `-d`, `--DP_key` **[str]**: FORMAT key to use for obtaining read depth (coverage) (**DEFAULT**: `DP`)\n* `-v`, `--PVR_key_new` **[str]**: INFO and FORMAT key to use for p-value for REF allele (**DEFAULT**: `PVR`)\n* `-V`, `--PVA_key_new` **[str]**: INFO and FORMAT key to use for p-values for ALT allele(s) (**DEFAULT**: `PVA`)\n* `-t`, `--min_AC` **[int]**: allele count cutoff (min reads allowed to support allele, REF or ALT) (**DEFAULT**: `0`)\n* `-q`, `--min_AF` **[float]**: minor allele frequency cutoff (min allowed, REF or ALT) (**DEFAULT**: `0`)\n* `-Q`, `--max_AF` **[float]**: major allele frequency cutoff (max allowed, REF or ALT) (**DEFAULT**: `1`)\n* `-D`, `--min_DP` **[int]**: read depth (coverage) cutoff (min allowed, REF or ALT) (**DEFAULT**: `1`)\n* `-I`, `--INFO_rules` **[str]**: custom rules for filtering based on the INFO column, formatted as a comma-separated string in the case of multiple rules; must use keys present in the INFO column, and must use one of the six the comparison operators `==`/`!=`/`<`/`<=`/`>=`/`>` (**DEFAULT**: `None`)\n\t* Example: `--INFO_rules=\"STB>0.5,STB<0.9\"`\n* `-s`, `--sample_rules` **[str]**: custom rules for filtering based on the sample column, formatted as a comma-separated string in the case of multiple rules; must use keys present in the FORMAT column, and must use one of the six the comparison operators `==`/`!=`/`<`/`<=`/`>=`/`>` (**DEFAULT**: `None`)\n\t* Example: `--sample_rules=\"FSRF>=5,FSRR>=5,FSAF>=5,FSAR>=5\"`\n* `-O`, `--overwrite_INFO` **[flag]**: for any data keys matching between INFO and FORMAT, OVERWRITE INFO data with <sample> (**DEFAULT**: `OFF`)\n\n## <a name=\"examples\"></a>EXAMPLES\n\n### EXAMPLE 1: Minimal Run (Simplest Possible)\n\nAt a minimum, two options are required: `--error_rate` and `--VCF_files` (see the [introduction example](#vcfgenie)).\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --error_rate=0.01103 --VCF_files=example_A.vcf > ex1.out\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: A Simple Run with Custom AC, AF, and DP Keys\n\nBy default, VCFgenie looks for allele count, allele frequency, and read depth data in the `FORMAT`/`sample` columns using the default data keys `AC`, `AF`, and `DP`, respectively. If your analysis will **not** use these default data keys, you must provide the keys to use for obtaining allele count (`--AC_key`), allele frequency (`--AF_key`), and read depth (`--DP_key`), in addition to the required options.\n\nBecause the file `example_B.vcf` uses `FAO`, `AF`, and `FDP` (quality-corrected values) for the required keys, we will specify these below; we will also give the output directory a specific name using the `--out_dir` parameter:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_B.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex2_out --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP > ex2.out\n\n### EXAMPLE 3: Miniumum AC, AF, and DP Values\n\nVCFgenie provides each variant's p-value in the INFO and sample columns. However, we can also tell VCFgenie to **eliminate** variants (i.e., set AC to 0) if they exceed a certain p-value threshold, set using `--p_cutoff`.\n\nIn what follows, we set a `--p_cutoff`, and we also specify a minimum acceptable allele count (`--min_AC`), minimum acceptable allele frequency (`--min_AF`), and minimum acceptable read depth (`--min_DP`):\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_B.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex3_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP --min_AC=10 --min_AF=0.01 --min_DP=100 > ex3.out\n\n### EXAMPLE 4: INFO and Sample-Based Rules\n\nWe can also implement additional rules based on the `INFO` or `sample` columns. For example, to specify that the `INFO` value of `STB` (strand bias) must be both greater than 0.5 and less than 0.9, run as follows:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_B.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex4a_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP --INFO_rules=\"STB>0.5,STB<0.9\" > ex4a.out\n\t\nTo instead implement rules based on the `sample` column, we can specify the allele counts for REF and ALT alleles must be at least 5 on the forward (`FSRF` and `FSAF`) and reverse (`FSRR` and `FSAR`) strands as follows:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_B.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex4b_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP --sample_rules=\"FSRF>=5,FSRR>=5,FSAF>=5,FSAR>=5\" > ex4b.out\n\t\nRules based on both the `INFO` and `sample` columns can be specified in the same run.\n\n### EXAMPLE 5: Multiple Input Files\n\nTo provide a specific list VCF files as input, simply separate their names with a space, as follows:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_B.vcf example_C.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex5a_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP > ex5a.out\n\nOne can also use wildcards to run multiple VCF files, e.g., **\\*.vcf** for all VCF files in the working directory. More specific character classes can be specified using braces **{}**. To reproduce example 5a using this approach, run as follows:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files example_{B,C}.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex5b_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AF_key=AF --DP_key=FDP > ex5b.out\n\n### EXAMPLE 6: All Options\n\nTo use all currently available options, run as follows:\n\n\tVCFgenie.py --VCF_files=example_C.vcf --error_rate=0.01103 --out_dir=ex6_out --p_cutoff=0.0001 --AC_key=FAO --AC_key_new=FAON --AF_key=AF --AF_key_new=AFN --DP_key=FDP --PVR_key_new=PVREF --PVA_key_new=PVALT --min_AC=10 --min_AF=0 --max_AF=1 --min_DP=100 --INFO_rules=\"STB>0.5,STB<0.9\" --sample_rules=\"FSRF>=5,FSRR>=5,FSAF>=5,FSAR>=5\" --overwrite_INFO > ex6.out\n\n\n## <a name=\"output\"></a>Output\r\n\r\n**VCFgenie** outputs the following information and results:\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"standard-output\"></a>Output 1: Standard Output\n\nAt the command line (Terminal), VCFgenie will report:\n\n1. a log of the input parameters\n2. the file(s) to be processed\n3. data regarding each failing allele and MULTIALLELIC site\n4. summary statistics **for each file**\n5. **total** summary statistics related to `AC`, `AF`, and `DP` of passing and failing alleles (original values, before correction)\n\nResults will be reported separately for the following categories:\n\n* `ALLELES`: all alleles\n* `REF`: REF alleles\n* `ALT`: ALT alleles\n* `MAJOR`: MAJOR (most common) alleles\n* `MINOR`: MINOR (not most common) alleles\n\nStatistics include:\n\n* `n`: total number of alleles observed of a given type / category\n* `min`: minimum value of attribute (e.g., `DP`)\n* `Q1`: first quartile (25th percentile)\n* `mean`: mean\n* `std`: standard deviation\n* `median`: median (50th percentile)\n* `Q3`: third quartile (75th percentile)\n* `max`: maximum\n\nNote that:\n\n1. The number of MINOR alleles will always equal the number of ALT alleles, because there can only be one MAJOR allele at a site and there can also only be one REF allele at a site. However, although equal in number, the identity of the alleles in each group (MINOR vs. ALT) are not the same.\n2. In rare instances, the `AF` of a MAJOR (most common) allele may be <50% at multiallelic sites. For example, suppose a site has the following alleles (counts): A (10 reads), C (700 reads), G (530 reads), and T (450 reads), for a total read depth of 1,690. In this case, even though C is the major allele, its `AF` is only 41.4%.\r\n\n### <a name=\"filtered-VCF-files\"></a>Output 2: Filtered VCF Output File(s)\n\nVCFgenie will produce one `*_filtered.vcf` file for each `*.vcf` file in the working directory, to be placed in `--out_dir` (DEFAULT: `VCFgenie_output`)\n\n## <a name=\"todo\"></a>TODO\r\n\r\nPlanned additions to VCFgenie include:\n\n1. Implement a flag for overwriting `--AC_key_new` and `--AF_key_new` values in the `INFO` column (**DONE!**)\n2. Allow an arbitrarily large number of samples (columns >10) to be automatically processed\n3. Allow analyses to be based on INFO column\n4. Allow all reads to be assigned to the REF (rather than MAJOR allele) at sites where all alleles fail\n5. Implement more complex sequencing error models in the form of user-provided 4x4 (nucleotide) and 64x4 (trinucleotide-context) matrices\n6. Graphical user interface (GUI)\n7. Add a \"split equal-length substitutions onto multiple lines\" option\n8. Add a \"split multiple ALT records onto multiple lines\" option\n\r\n## <a name=\"troubleshooting\"></a>Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about **VCFgenie**, please first click on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/chasewnelson/VCFgenie/issues\">Issues</a> tab at the top of this page to see if your question has already been asked.
