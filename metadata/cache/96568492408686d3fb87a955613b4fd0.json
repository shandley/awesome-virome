    "abstract": "This International Workshop on Global Software Development for the Practitioner (GSD2006) was held in conjunction with the 28th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2006) on May 23rd, 2006 in Shanghai, China. The workshop was motivated by the industry trend towards developing software in globally distributed settings: geographically distributed teams, or outsourcing parts of the software development to other organizations in other parts of the world. Topics presented and discussed in the workshop focused on grounded, practical strategies and techniques that address the geographic, temporal, organizational, and cultural boundaries inherent in global software projects.",
