It needs to be used in conjunction with `-1 [FORWARD_READS_FILE]` and `-2 [REVERSE_READS_FILE]`\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* [MetaPhlAn] Fixed a bug that would halt MetaPhlAn execution when the option `--profile_vsc` was used but had no viral hits\r\n* [MetaPhlAn] Fixed a bug that would halt MetaPhlAn execution when the number of reads to map was zero\r\n* [StrainPhlAn] Fixed a bug in the new implementation (since v4.1) of `\u2013-print_clades_only`"
