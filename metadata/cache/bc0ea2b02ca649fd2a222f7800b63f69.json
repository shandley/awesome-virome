        "description": "<p>In a world where borders are no longer defined by geography but by firewalls and data flows, The Cyber Eye: Inside the Network Wars and Secrets of the Five Eyes Alliance unveils the secret battles shaping global power. Written by cybersecurity expert Karwan Mustafa Kareem, this deeply researched book explores the covert operations, alliances, and rivalries of the digital age. From the clandestine origins of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to the rising cyber powers challenging Western dominance, The Cyber Eye traverses a complex web of surveillance, espionage, artificial intelligence, and international intrigue. It provides an unprecedented look at how intelligence agencies harness algorithms, big data, and AI to monitor, predict, and manipulate global events. Through detailed case studies&mdash;from China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism to Russia&rsquo;s disinformation warfare, from Iran&rsquo;s asymmetric cyber strategies to the growing cyber ambitions of India and regional actors&mdash;this book captures the strategic, ethical, and technical dimensions of modern intelligence warfare. Readers are taken inside cyberattacks like Stuxnet, SolarWinds, and PRISM, and shown how mass surveillance, private-sector complicity, and algorithmic governance are redefining national security and privacy. In its final chapters, the book proposes a forward-looking AI-centric cybersecurity defense model tailored for Kurdistan, offering a blueprint for developing nations seeking digital resilience. The Cyber Eye is essential reading for cybersecurity professionals, intelligence analysts, policymakers, academics, and anyone who wants to understand the shifting foundations of global power in the 21st century.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this talk, given at the 2025 Memorial Zaliznjak's Readings, I discuss the evolution of the particle KA in Russian.&nbsp; This enclitic particle expresses the meaning of soft encouragement in standard Modern Russian and attaches to imperative forms or ininitial proclitics like NU that can are semantically equivalent to imperatives. A close semantic parallel is provided by the Danish imperative particle LIGE that conveys a similar meaning. However, in the Russian dialects and in the Russian language of the XIX century, the particle KA is also used as a proximal deictic marker 'here and now' or 'towards the speaker' and attaches to other clitic hosts, e. g. personal pronouns (MNE-KA), wh-words (GDE-KA), etc. Max Vasmer in his Etymological Dictionary (vol. 1, 1964) takes for granted that the deictic KA (which has Slavic parallels) and imperative KA represent the single element. However, Vladimir Orel (2007) in his Etymological Dictionary accepts Igor S. Vahros's hypothesis (1984) that the imperative KA is a recent Russian innovation rooted in rapid colloquial speech and based on the allegro-variant of some focus particle going back to Proto-Slavic <em>*toliko</em>. He claims furthermore that the initial form is neither -KA, nor -KO, but -TKO ( &lt; TOK<em>O</em> &lt; T<em>O</em>L'KO &lt; TOL<em>I</em>KO) and assumes that the imperative -KA /-KO /-TKO was absent from Old Russian. This theory, attractive as it is, must be rejected ipso facto since the imperative KA is safely documented by the Old Novgorod Birch bark letters \u2116 109 and 854 dating with XII century, while deictic KA is attested in the same epoch by the Birch Bark letter 652. Moreover, the Birch bark letter \u2116 1002 (XII century) already contains the compound deictic particle KO-VO, known from Northern Russian dialects. Andrej A. Zaliznjak (1993, 2004, 2008) correctly classified Old Russian KA as a 2P particle conforming to Wackernagel's law, though he stated that the data is too scanty to predict the place of KA in Old Russian clitic clusters.&nbsp; Regarding the Birch bark letter \u2116 109, where KA attaches to the clause-initial adverbial NYN<span lang=\"RU\">\u0114, Zaliznjak initially (1989) assumed that NYN\u0114KA is a single lexical element characteristic of South-West Russia, though in 1993 he converted to the syntactic analysis with Wackernagel's law. Zaliznjak's first hypothesis was later supported by Polekhov &amp; Krysko (2021) and Gippius et. al. (2023) provided that the author of the Birch bark letter \u2116 109, certain <em>Zhiznomir</em>, indeed had clear Old South Russian features in his idiolect. However, the probable South Russian origin of Zhiznomir does not undermine the syntactic analysis of &nbsp;NYN\u0114=KA since the context is unequivocally imperative.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"RU\">Comments. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"RU\">&nbsp;The Acknowledgments, incl. the gratitudes to the conference participants are on slide 29 of the revised presentation. All disclaimers follow.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"RU\">&nbsp;On the reasons of space, I don't discuss the important contribution of Pertsov (1996) claiming a morphological approach to the imperative KA in Modern Russian. This paper is listed in the References. Neither do I discuss Levontina's claim (2019) that the particle KA tends to expand its syntactics in Modern Russian. This paper is listed in the References, too. The checking of these claims requires an analysis of corpus data which is beyond the reach of this paper.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"RU\">Andrej A. Zaliznjak's views of the Old Russian particle KA and its occurrences in the epigraphic documents have changed substantially in the period from 1989 to 1995 \u2015 a detail which might be of interest for his biographers. In 1989, see [\u041d\u0413\u0411 VIII] in the References, he clined towards a morphological analysis of NYN\u0114KA in the Birch bark letter \u2116 109 (early XII century) but mentioned the cryptic spelling [T]OUTE KA &lt;wrote X&gt; 'X wrote right here' in the graffito (\u041c\u0435\u0434\u044b\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 1978, \u2116 212). If he assumed a syntactic approach in 1989, he should treat &nbsp;NYN\u0114=KA 'right now' on a par with TOUTE=KA 'right here'. In 1993, see [\u041d\u0413\u0411 IX: 285 ] in the References, he already mentions that Birk barch letters 109 and 682 contain the enclitic particle KA but do not mention the (\u041c\u0435\u0434\u044b\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 1978, \u2116 212). In the first edition of \"Old Novgorod Dialect\" (1995), Zaliznjak does not treat -KA in NYN\u0114KA from the Birch bark letter \u2116 109 as a suffix but do not comment its status as a clitic either. This gap is filled in the 2nd edition of \"Old Novgorod Dialect\" (2004: 259), where &nbsp;NYN\u0114KA from \u2116 109 is explicitly analyzed as NYN\u0114=KA, i. e. as a clitic host NYN\u0114 + enclitic =KA. The same syntactic interpretation is taken in the book Zaliznjak (2008). Finally, in 2018, Savva V. Mikheev (see the 'Related Works' section) showed the reading [T]OUTE KA &lt;wrote X&gt; 'X wrote right here' in the graffito (\u041c\u0435\u0434\u044b\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 1978, \u2116 212) is a phantom,. Therefore, this Novgorod graffito must be excluded from the list of Old Russian documents containing the particle =KA.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>",

Frequent variations in airfare for the same flight often pose challenges for securing economical options. This predictive model resolves such issues by estimating ticket prices, helping users save money and understand price trends better. </span></em><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\">The strategy makes use of sophisticated machine learning techniques and historical flight data</span></em><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\"> to ensure dependable fare predictions. Key factors, such as departure times, airlines, travel dates, destinations, and other pertinent information and analysed to discern patterns influencing pricing.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\">The system incorporates a number of machine learning strategies, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and</span></em><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\"> Support Vector Regression. By delivering fare estimates and insights into pricing trends, this system enables users to make informed booking choices. Its integration into flight booking platforms </span></em><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\">provides a useful resource for </span></em><em><span lang=\"EN-IN\">travellers to find cost-effective options and plan trips with ease.</span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p>Waste accumulation in forest regions can have a severe impact on the soil mycobiome. However, research on soil fungi inhabiting forest disposal sites remains limited. Therefore, this study focused on the taxonomy and phylogeny of ascomycetes isolated from soil in forest dump-sites in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The fungal strains were identified using morphological characterisations and multigene phylogenetic reconstruction. A new genus, <i>Pseudoleptodontidium</i>, typified by <i>Ps. chiangmaiense</i> sp. nov. (Amphisphaeriales genera <i>incertae sedis</i>, Xylariomycetidae), along with two new species, <i>Penicillium chiangmaiense</i> (series <i>Janthinella</i>, section Lanata-Divaricata) and <i>P. terrae</i> (series <i>Erubescentia</i>, section Exilicaulis) (Aspergillaceae, Eurotiales), are described in detail and compared with closely-related species. Our discovery offers valuable insights into the soil ascomycetes associated with forest disturbances.</p>",

This comprehensive review explores the role of predictive modeling and risk management techniques in the financial sector, highlighting their applications in forecasting potential risks and optimizing decision-making processes. Predictive modeling, powered by advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, enables financial institutions to forecast trends, detect anomalies, and predict the likelihood of various risk events such as credit defaults, market volatility, and operational disruptions. By analyzing historical data, financial institutions can identify patterns that allow them to make informed predictions about future events, enhancing their ability to mitigate risks proactively. The review covers various predictive modeling techniques, including regression analysis, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods, discussing their strengths, limitations, and applications in risk assessment. It also explores how these models are integrated with risk management frameworks to improve the accuracy of risk identification and the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. A key aspect of this review is the importance of data quality, model calibration, and continuous monitoring in ensuring the reliability of predictive models. Additionally, the review highlights the intersection of predictive modeling and traditional risk management techniques such as Value at Risk (VaR), stress testing, and scenario analysis. The integration of these techniques with machine learning-driven models allows for more comprehensive and dynamic risk assessments. Furthermore, the growing importance of regulatory compliance in financial risk management is examined, with a focus on how predictive models help institutions comply with stringent regulatory requirements, such as those set by Basel III and Dodd-Frank. In conclusion, the integration of predictive modeling with risk management techniques in financial services is a powerful tool for enhancing risk identification, mitigating potential threats, and optimizing resource allocation. As financial markets continue to evolve, adopting advanced predictive modeling techniques will be essential for maintaining financial stability and competitive advantage.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

Effective ecological restoration requires advancing mechanistic understanding of flow-ecology relationships across time.</p>\n<p>This study presents a hybrid attribution framework integrating seasonality analysis and machine learning to explore drivers of flow-ecology coupling in China's Han River Basin.By integrating structural equation modeling and machine learning principles, we propose induced machine learning models to establish flow-ecology relationships, achieving R&sup2; of 0.8 in simulating riverine NDVI. Employing optimized LSTM-Transformer models (NSE&gt;0.95), we project flow patterns, and predict vegetation responses under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios (2025-2035) based on induced machine learning.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, another zoonotic virus has begun to gain attention: Orthohantaviruses. Orthohantaviruses, a rare but deadly group of zoonotic viruses, are responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).[1] a severe respiratory disease with a mortality rate of up to 50%. <span>This virus is rapidly showing its increasing trends in </span><span>South America and North America, with a significant mortality rate.[2] </span>In Argentina, most of<span> the cases required hospitalization, as more than 84% developed severe respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation</span><span>.[3] Up to now, only supportive and limited treatment options are available.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Transmission</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Exposure to rodents, faeces, or rodent bites are the predominant causes of HPS. Moreover, people who are in forestry occupations, or with a history of cleaning rodent-infested areas, and those who are farmers are at the highest risk of developing this infection.[4] </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Clinical presentation</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Initially, the patient presents with a raised temperature, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, headache, abdominal discomfort, and eventually diarrhea. </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Later, pulmonary symptoms develop<span>, such as a non-productive cough and a shortness of breath, with mild to moderate respiratory compromise, pulmonary infiltration, and pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory failure with hemodynamic compromise abruptly and cause&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden&nbsp;death.[4]</span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Current treatment</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As mentioned above, despite having supportive treatment options available in intensive care units, such as ventilation, fluid balance, inotropic agents, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which pump the deoxygenated blood outside the body and add oxygen, thus balancing the oxygen/carbon dioxide (O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in blood, one-third of the patients still expire within the first 48 hours following admission. Regarding ribavirin, </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">while a few studies have explored potential treatment options, none have been conclusively proven effective<span>. </span><span>Recently, many vaccines have been introduced and used in China and Korea, but their long-term consequences are still unknown.[5,6] </span><span>Thus, sufficient studies on treatment and management approaches must be conducted to curb this contagious disease effectively.</span></span></p>",
