      "abstract": "<jats:p>\u00a0&#x0D;\nThe Republic of Serbia is one of the few, if not the only country in the world that, at ratification and translation of the term \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d- heritage which appears in two significant and related international conventions of UNESCO, used different terms: \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d- \"heritage\", with regard to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, and ''nasledje'' -inheritance in the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the reasons for the subsequent rejection of the term heritage could lay in the opinion that it was the case of (end of 20th and beginning of the 21st century) political bureaucratic introduction of an old, forgotten word, which also contains the notion of gender incorrectness based on pointing out the inheritance through the male line, which could be in conflict with international law. The views expressed in this paper suggest the unsustainability of these claims, as well as greater suitability of the term \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d- heritage. Namely, the ratification of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage was done as early as in 1974, and since then the term \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d- heritage was used, its new introduction into use on the basis of recent daily political aspirations cannot be the case. At the same time inheritance through the male line is encountered with the use of the Latin word \"patrimonium\", which is the basis for the terms used in the official translation of the UNESCO-listed conventions in French and Spanish: \"patrimoine\" and \"patrimonio\" (and other Roman languages) so that the use of the term \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d \u2013heritage cannot be a violation of international legal norms. Finally, bearing in mind the fact that, in general, use of languages is \u200b\u200bimpossible to achieve complete gender purism, it is necessary to emphasize that in contrast to the term \"nasledje'' \u2013 inheritance, the term \u201cba\u0161tina\u201d \u2013 heritage is more suitable for use in Serbian language when it comes to the concept of inheritance, preservation and transmission of universal values \u200b\u200bpromoted by the UNESCO Convention, as well as for translating the notion of heritage science.&#x0D;\n\u00a0</jats:p>",

Due to the large diversity in precursors, there is no universal approach yet that can be taken to keep a terrorist from using them to make explosives. INHERIT proposes to develop a multi-disciplined approach to intervene across multiple stages of the terrorism timeline. INHERIT has assembled a multi-faceted team with experience of all aspects of four important steps in this timeline. With a focus on explosive precursor chemicals, the team will work to develop technologies directed towards thwarting the ability of terrorists to exploit these materials for production of explosives.  Methodologies to render chemicals inert, more readily detectable and capable of yielding greater forensic value will all be pursued. Collaboration between the diverse teams developing these interventions will ensure a coordinated holistic approach across all threat materials identified. This holistic approach will also be applicable in the struggle against emerging and future HME threats. The knowledge and insight resulting from INHERIT testing and analysis will be fed to targeted authorities, legislators, and organisations through a dissemination process which will include meetings, workshops and conferences conducted at appropriate security levels.",
