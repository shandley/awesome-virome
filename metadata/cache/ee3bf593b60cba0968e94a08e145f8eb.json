Specifically, coding sequences (CDS) were predicted with PHANOTATE (McNair, et al. 2019), tRNAs were predicted with tRNAscan-SE 2.0 (Chan, et al. 2021), tmRNAs were predicted with Aragorn (Laslett, et al. 2004) and CRISPRs were preducted with CRT (Bland, et al. 2007). Functional annotation was generated by matching each CDS to the PHROGs (Terzian, et al. 2021), VFDB (Chen, et al. 2005) and CARD (Alcock, et al. 2020) databases using MMseqs2 (Steinegger, et al. 2017) and PyHMMER (Larralde, et al. 2023). Contigs were matched to their closest hit in the INPHARED database (Cook, et al. 2021) using mash (Ondov, et al. 2016). Plots were created with pyCirclize (Shimoyama 2022).\n\nWith the following full citations for the constituent tools below where relevant:\n\n* Cook R, Brown N, Redgwell T, Rihtman B, Barnes M, Clokie M, Stekel DJ, Hobman JL, Jones MA, Millard A.
