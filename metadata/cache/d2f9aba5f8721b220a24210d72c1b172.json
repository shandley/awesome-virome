However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins.\n\nWe propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus\u2013Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.\n\nWe make all of our data and code available on GitHub [https://github.com/QData/DeepVHPPI](https://github.com/QData/DeepVHPPI).\n\n\n![demo1](zmedia/deepVH2.png)\n![demo2](zmedia/deepVH3.png)\n![demo3](zmedia/deepVH4.png)\n\n\n### Citations\n\n```\n@article {Lanchantin2020.12.14.422772,\n\tauthor = {Lanchantin, Jack and Weingarten, Tom and Sekhon, Arshdeep and Miller, Clint and Qi, Yanjun},\n\ttitle = {Transfer Learning for Predicting Virus-Host Protein Interactions for Novel Virus Sequences},\n\telocation-id = {2020.12.14.422772},\n\tyear = {2021},\n\tdoi = {10.1101/2020.12.14.422772},\n\tpublisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},\n\tabstract = {Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 infect the human body by forming interactions between virus proteins and human proteins.
