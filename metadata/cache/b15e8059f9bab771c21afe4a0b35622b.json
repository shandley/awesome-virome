It provides commentary regarding the placement of these characters within themes of \u2018womanhood\u2019 and intergenerational women\u2019s solidarity, using the teen heroine Abby from <italic>Elektra</italic> (2005) as a unique case study. Drawing from postfeminist ideals of self-actualization and being true to oneself, the film actively participates in discussions around what it means for girls to become women via a female superhero narrative. Subsequently, the chapter builds on this discussion to consider the theme of superhero legacy through the character of Wolverine clone Laura Kinney in <italic>Logan</italic> (2017).</p>",

The chapter also highlights the twinned historical trajectories of comics and film and their entanglement with American (gender) politics throughout their existence, while also providing an overview of postfeminist culture and the implications of adaptation in these films. A chapter breakdown is provided, as well as an overview of the book\u2019s key arguments.</p>",

Looking ahead, the book concludes by remarking on current politics and their relationship to the future of the Marvel film adaptation. Further avenues of investigation with particular reference to issues of reception and quality as well as the current state of superheroines on the small screen are also considered. The conclusion draws attention to Marvel films as worthwhile objects of interrogation, representing issues of gender representation that are still prevalent in Western media culture. The overarching argument regarding the heterogeneous but often problematic representations of Marvel women is reiterated, while hope for the future of both comics and film in using the potential of the superhero genre to validate the existence of marginalised and disempowered peoples is expressed.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter takes as its focus another rarely examined subject\u2014Marvel\u2019s villainesses and evil women. It examines how and why comic book notions of feminine villainy are appropriated and exaggerated to shape a version of the Marvel villainess as aberrant and culturally abject. Keeping in mind existing debates about the gendered meaning of evil, characters such as the evil Jean Grey and snake-woman Viper of the <italic>X-Men</italic> films, and Hela in <italic>Thor: Ragnarok</italic> (2017) are historically contextualised. In these, fissures in the discourses of postfeminism\u2014so often engaged with the empowering qualities of feminine heterosexuality\u2014become more disjointed when considering the denigration of female sexual assertion present in these portrayals. Such representations signal postfeminist culture\u2019s complex relationship with issues of feminine sexuality, linking also to themes of mental distress and the toxicity of the abject female body. These narratives amplify the oppressive tendencies of such discourses when considering both the comics on which they are based and their ultimate outcomes, which usually involve narrative punishment such as death, for the villainess. These characters indicate the ways in which discourses of sexual liberation and pleasure are still highly regulated within postfeminist culture.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter considers the issue of race representation in Marvel films with specific reference to the portrayal of women of colour. Themes of whiteness and privilege run throughout each of the previous chapters; this chapter therefore interrogates many of the discourses of inclusion and equality central to some of these films, while querying the notion of a postracial culture. Continuing discussions from the previous chapters, Marvel films are positioned within a globalised, postfeminist and postracial media culture that encourages a notion of universal womanhood based on the oppression of all women. Women of colour remain marginalised in Marvel films through a range of cultural and industrial practices, regardless of the character types they play. The representations of characters such as Storm in the <italic>X-Men</italic> films and Dr Karen Jenson in <italic>Blade</italic> are discussed.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The concept of identity in superhero narratives has become a burgeoning field in academic studies of this increasingly popular cinematic genre. <italic>Women in Marvel Films</italic> provides the first rigorous analysis of the portrayals of women, heroic and otherwise, in films based on Marvel comics from the 1980s to the present. It explores the relationships between this cultural phenomenon and wider issues of gender equality, considering the cultural moments in which Marvel films are made and incorporating complex histories of the comic book and Hollywood industries. Highlighting characterisations of women, narratives and cinematic elements such as music and <italic>mise-en-sc\u00e8ne</italic>, and questioning how these elements collectively engage with gendered discourses, the discussion also positions previous iterations of women in Marvel comic book narratives as highly relevant. <italic>Women in Marvel Films</italic> thereby considers how feminist issues surface within superhero adaptations and how they are dealt with via Hollywood and comic book conventions. This book ultimately shows how the Marvel superhero film taps into political complexities regarding gender and related identity issues, such as women\u2019s roles in society and their relation to men, and provides a fascinating insight into gendered power dynamics in contemporary American popular culture. The films discussed include <italic>The Punisher</italic> (1989), <italic>Blade</italic> (1998), the <italic>X-Men</italic> series (2000\u20132020), <italic>Elektra</italic> (2005), and the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including <italic>Black Panther</italic> (2018) and C<italic>aptain Marvel</italic> (2019).</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This introductory chapter explains how several trends and individuals had come together to eventually produce \u201cthe best Marvel comic of the 1970s.\u201d The comic in question is, in fact, <italic>Enigma</italic> (1993), by Vertigo, an imprint of Marvel's rival, DC Comics. To explain this discrepancy and why the 1970s is a particularly significant era in Marvel's history, the chapter explores the various characteristics which make <italic>Enigma</italic> an artistic success. It argues that <italic>Enigma</italic> was indeed a product of trends, aspects, approaches, and characters that were already developed in Marvel titles from the 1970s. And yet the same Marvel-derived features that give <italic>Enigma</italic> its strength arrive in a form that even the most permissive editors at Marvel would never have let see the light of day. Seen from the perspective of 1970s Marvel, the artistic triumph of <italic>Enigma</italic> is bittersweet, its creators materialized the aspirations that the publishing industry, the Comics Code, and the broader culture never let their predecessors achieve in their purest form.</p>",
