  "data": "# ViralConsensus\nViralConsensus is a fast and memory-efficient tool for calling viral consensus genome sequences directly from read alignment data. ViralConsensus is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than existing methods. Further, unlike existing methods, ViralConsensus can pipe data directly from a read mapper via standard input and performs viral consensus calling on-the-fly, making it an ideal tool for viral sequencing pipelines.\n\nNote that, although the tool's name implies that it is primarily meant for viral genomics, ViralConsensus can be used to build consensus genome sequences from arbitrary genomes (e.g. bacterial, mitochondrial, etc.), as long as there is a single reference sequence that is being used for reconstruction. The caveat is that memory consumption scales linearly with reference genome length, meaning ultra-long reference genomes (e.g. human chromosomes) may require prohibitively large amounts of memory (though they may be feasible in large-memory systems).\n\nTo run ViralConsensus, you can either install the command-line tool (instructions below), or you can try out the [web app](https://niema.net/ViralConsensus) created by my student, [Daniel Ji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielji26), which is a complete WebAssembly port of ViralConsensus (meaning it runs fully client-side in your own web browser!). The web app works well for reasonably small datasets, but for larger datasets, you will want to use the command-line tool.\n\n# Installation\nViralConsensus is written in C++ and depends on htslib. First, you need to install all dependencies (if you haven't already):\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get install -y automake bzip2 gcc g++ git libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev liblzma-dev make wget zlib1g-dev\nwget -qO- \"https://github.com/samtools/htslib/releases/download/1.18/htslib-1.18.tar.bz2\" | tar -xj\ncd htslib-*\nautoreconf -i\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nIn order to compile and run ViralConsensus, htslib needs to be installed in your environment's library path. If you followed the instructions above (so htslib was installed in `/usr/local`), you may need to add the following to your `.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib\"\n```\n\nThen, you can simply download the latest release tarball (or clone this repo) and compile with `make`:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/niemasd/ViralConsensus.git\ncd ViralConsensus\nmake\nsudo mv viral_consensus /usr/local/bin/ # optional; install executable globally\n```\n\nYou can also install ViralConsensus via [conda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/viral_consensus/README.html), and you can find a Docker container of ViralConsensus on DockerHub ([niemasd/viral_consensus](https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/viral_consensus)).\n\n# Usage\n```\nviral_consensus -i IN_READS -r REF_GENOME -o OUT_CONSENSUS [-op OUT_POS_COUNTS] [-oi OUT_INS_COUNTS] [-q MIN_QUAL] [-d MIN_DEPTH] [-f MIN_FREQ] [-a AMBIG] [-p PRIMER_BED] [-po PRIMER_OFFSET]\n  -i/--in_reads IN_READS                Input reads file (CRAM/BAM/SAM), or '-' for standard input\n  -r/--ref_genome REF_GENOME            Input reference genome (FASTA)\n  -o/--out_consensus OUT_CONSENSUS      Output consensus genome (FASTA), or '-' for standard output\n  -op/--out_pos_counts OUT_POS_COUNTS   Output position counts (TSV), or '-' for standard output (default: don't output)\n  -oi/--out_ins_counts OUT_INS_COUNTS   Output insertion counts (JSON), or '-' for standard output (default: don't output)\n  -q/--min_qual MIN_QUAL                Minimum base quality to count base in counts (default: 20)\n  -d/--min_depth MIN_DEPTH              Minimum depth to call base/insertion in consensus (default: 10)\n  -f/--min_freq MIN_FREQ                Minimum frequency to call base/insertion in consensus (default: 0.5)\n  -a/--ambig AMBIG                      Ambiguous symbol (default: N)\n  -p/--primer_bed PRIMER_BED            Primer file (BED)\n  -po/--primer_offset PRIMER_OFFSET     Number of bases after primer to also trim (default: 0)\n  -v/--version                          Print version number\n  -h/--help                             Print this usage message\n```\n\n## Piping from Read Mapper\nBecause ViralConsensus does not require reads to be sorted, data can be piped directly from the read mapper to ViralConsensus to avoid unnecessary disk I/O (and thus improve speed):\n\n```bash\n# ViralConsensus is single-threaded, so if running many samples, best to run mapper single-threaded as well and parallelize across samples\nminimap2 -t 1 -a -x sr reference.fas reads.fastq.gz | viral_consensus -i - -r reference.fas -o consensus.fas\n```\n\nUsers will likely want to keep the output of the read mapper (e.g. as a compressed BAM file) for other downstream analyses, but rather than writing the output SAM/BAM/CRAM to disk and *then* having ViralConsensus read from that file, `tee` should be used instead to send the stream down two (or more) paths:\n\n```bash\nminimap2 -t 1 -a -x sr reference.fas reads.fastq.gz | tee >(viral_consensus -i - -r reference.fas -o consensus.fas) | samtools view -b -@ 1 > reads.bam\n```\n\n# Output Files\nViralConsensus produces 3 output files: the consensus sequence (FASTA), base counts at every position (TSV), and insertion counts before every position (JSON). You can visualize the position base counts TSV file in [SamBamViz](http://niema.net/SamBamViz) to look at coverage across the genome as well as to look at base counts at each position.\n\n# Citing ViralConsensus\nIf you use ViralConsensus in your work, please cite:\n\n> Moshiri N (2023). \"ViralConsensus: A fast and memory-efficient tool for calling viral consensus genome sequences directly from read alignment data.\" *Bioinformatics*. btad317.
