Most of SPAdes pipelines support hybrid mode, i.e. allow using long reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) as a supplementary data.\n\nSPAdes package contains assembly pipelines for isolated and single-cell bacterial, as well as metagenomic and transcriptomic data.\nAdditional modes allow to discover bacterial plasmids and RNA viruses, as well as perform HMM-guided assembly.\nBesides, SPAdes package includes supplementary tools for efficient k-mer counting and k-mer-based read filtering, assembly graph construction and simplification, sequence-to-graph alignment and metagenomic binning refinement.\n\n- [Complete SPAdes user manual](https://ablab.github.io/spades/)\n\n- [SPAdes download page](https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/latest/)\n\n- [Latest SPAdes publication](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpbi.102)\n\nCurrent version: see `VERSION` file.\n\n# Quick start\n\n- Complete user manual can be found [here](https://ablab.github.io/spades/). Information below is provided merely for your convenience and cannot be considered as the user guide.\n\n- SPAdes assembler supports:\n  - Assembly of second-generation sequencing data (Illumina or IonTorrent);\n  - PacBio and Nanopore reads that are used as supplementary data only.\n\n- SPAdes allows to assemble genomes, metagenomes, transcriptomes, viral genomes etc.\n\n- Download SPAdes binaries for Linux or MacOS [here](https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/latest/). You can also compile SPAdes from [source](https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/latest/) (requires g++ 9.0+, cmake 3.16+, zlib and libbz2). SPAdes requires only Python 3.8+ to be installed.\n\n- Test your SPAdes installation by running\n\n```\n    bin/spades.py --test\n```\n\n- A single paired-end library (separate files, gzipped):\n\n```\n    bin/spades.py -1 left.fastq.gz -2 right.fastq.gz -o output_folder\n```\n\n\n- IonTorrent data:\n```\n    bin/spades.py --iontorrent -s it_reads.fastq -o output_folder\n```\n\n- A paired-end library coupled with long PacBio reads:\n\n```\n    bin/spades.py -1 left.fastq.gz -2 right.fastq.gz --pacbio pb.fastq -o output_folder\n```\n\n- Available assembly modes: `--isolate`, `--sc`, `--plasmid`, `--meta`, `--metaplasmid`, `--metaviral`, `--rna`, `--rnaviral`,  `--bio`, `--corona`, `--sewage`.\n\n- Standalone tools in SPAdes package: k-mer counting, k-mer cardinality estimation, k-mer-based read filtering, assembly graph construction, assembly graph simplification, alignment of long reads to an assembly graph, refinement of metagenomic binning.\n\n\n# Citation\nIf you use SPAdes in your research, please cite [our latest paper](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpbi.102).\n\nIn case you perform hybrid assembly using  PacBio or Nanopore reads, you may also cite [Antipov et al., 2015](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/20/bioinformatics.btv688.short). If you use multiple paired-end and/or mate-pair libraries you may additionally cite papers describing SPAdes repeat resolution algorithms [Prjibelski et al., 2014](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/12/i293.short) and [Vasilinetc et al., 2015](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/20/3262.abstract). \n\nIf you use other pipelines, please cite the following papers:\n\n-   metaSPAdes: [Nurk et al., 2017](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/5/824.short).\n-   plasmidSPAdes: [Antipov et al., 2016](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/22/3380/2525610).\n-   metaplasmidSPAdes / plasmidVerify: [Antipov et al., 2019](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/6/961.short)\n-   metaviralSPAdes / viralVerify: [Antipov et al., 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/36/14/4126/5837667)\n-   rnaSPAdes: [Bushmanova et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/9/giz100/5559527).\n-   biosyntheticSPAdes: [Meleshko et al., 2019](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2019/06/03/gr.243477.118?top=1).\n-   coronaSPAdes: [Meleshko et al., 2022](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/1/1/6354349).\n\nYou may also include older papers [Nurk, Bankevich et al., 2013](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-37195-0_13) or [Bankevich, Nurk et al., 2012](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.2012.0021), especially if you assemble single-cell data.\n\n\n# Feedback and bug reports\n\nPlease, leave your comments and bug reports at [our GitHub repository tracker](https://github.com/ablab/spades/issues).
