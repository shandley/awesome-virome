      "body": "\r\n*NOTE*: Downloading the binaries will not help you to set up `Cenote-Taker 2`. If you haven't already installed Cenote-Taker 2, please follow installation/update instructions in README, including the database updates.\r\n\r\nUpdate notes:\r\n\r\n1. Major changes have been made to make the installation faster, easier and have a smaller data footprint (was ~130GB and now is ~8GB to ~75GB depending on your database choices). Details:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tools (either tricky to install or out of date) were removed from the dependencies: `krona`, `emboss suite`, `circlator`, `mummer`.\r\n- [ ] The following tools were added to the dependencies: `seqkit`\r\n- [ ] The following tools were changed from stand-alone git clones to packages in the conda environment: `lastal/lastdb`, `hhblits/hhsearch`, `phanotate`.\r\n- [ ] The protein BLAST database of RefSeq etc sequences was updated to include ~3000 new RefSeq virus entries\r\n- [ ] The hhsuite databases are now optional. PDB, PFAM, CDD\r\n\r\n2. The tool now checks that your run_title is appropriately formatted\r\n3. For contigs with DTRs (direct terminal repeats), the `--wrap` option allows users to choose either: clip repeat region and rotate contig to an appropriate position, or forgo rotating and clipping but DTRs are reported in the genome map. #29 \r\n4. Certain `rm` commands were fixed. #21 \r\n5. The taxonomy calling framework has been updated. NCBI Taxdump files are used for TaxIDs instead of the krona database. \"tax_guide.blastx.out\" files now show the taxid of the best hit, and have tab-separated hierarchical taxonomy info for that reference. Example:\r\n```\r\nexample_ct1_1\tgi|849254117|ref|YP_009150201.1| terminase [Propionibacterium phage PHL085N00]\t45.575\t9.81e-119\t452\r\ntaxid: 1500812\r\n10239\tViruses\tsuperkingdom\r\n2731341\tDuplodnaviria\tclade\r\n2731360\tHeunggongvirae\tkingdom\r\n2731618\tUroviricota\tphylum\r\n2731619\tCaudoviricetes\tclass\r\n28883\tCaudovirales\torder\r\n10699\tSiphoviridae\tfamily\r\n1982251\tPahexavirus\tgenus\r\n1982275\tPahexavirus PHL037M02\tspecies\r\n```\r\n6. protein sequence based taxonomy now is more flexible, with thresholds for genome taxon assignment:\r\n\r\n| Hallmark AAI to Reference  | Taxonomic granularity from CT2 |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| >90%  | Genus, e.g. \"Ilzatvirus\"  |\r\n| >40%  | Family, e.g. \"Siphoviridae\"  |\r\n| >25%  | Order, e.g. \"Caudovirales\"  |\r\n| =<25%  | Generic name, e.g. \"phage\"  |\r\n\r\n7. `--hallmark_taxonomy` option allows users to get hierarchical taxonomy information for all identified hallmark genes. This could be useful for more sophisticated downstream taxonomy assignments.\r\n8. `-db virion` is now the default setting. I think most people are inputting contigs assembled from WGS data, and this is the correct option for this data type.\r\n\r\nGood luck with all of your Cenotes :neckbeard: :sparkling_heart:\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"
