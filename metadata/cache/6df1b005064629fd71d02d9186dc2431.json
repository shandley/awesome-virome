    "abstract": "Seed vigor has traditionally been evaluated by physiological, biochemical and stress tolerance tests. More recently, with the use of computerized image analysis, objective information has become accessible in a relatively short period of time, with less human interference. The aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of computerized seedling image analysis by Seed Vigor Imaging System (SVIS\u00ae) to detect differences in vigor between carrot (Daucus carota L.) seed lots as compared to those provided by traditional vigor tests. Seeds from seven lots from the Brasilia cultivar were subjected to a germination test, first count of germination, speed of germination, accelerated aging with saline solution and seedling emergence; furthermore, a vigor index, growth index and uniformity index were determined by the Seed Vigor Imaging System (SVIS\u00ae) during four evaluation periods. The results obtained by the computerized seedling analysis (vigor index and growth index) show that SVIS\u00ae is efficient in assessing carrot seed vigor.",
