    "title": "AXIe\u00ae 2.0 and MVP-C: Open ATE software standards",
    "abstract": "Open software standards AXIe\u00ae2.0 and MVP-C are introduced. The AXIe\u00ae2.0 software standard provides an interface mechanism to hardware by supplying inventory, parallel addressing (multi-site) and tester configuration services. The AXIe\u00ae2.0 is the software companion to the AXIe\u00ae1.1 hardware standard. The MVP-C standard (Multisite Virtual Pin - C language) is a set of a comprehensive, multiple level instrument API standards, which provide enhancement of existing instrumentation software standards for high performance, ATE test systems. Together, the AXIe\u00ae2.0 and MVP-C standards, supply a consistent methodology for ATE vendors to use as a partial or complete solution. For ATE customers, the option of truly mixing vendors' solutions becomes a software reality, and with it, the potential for substantial cost savings.",
