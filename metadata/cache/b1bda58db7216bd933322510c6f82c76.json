  "data": "# PHACTS\n\nA simple program to classify the lifestyle of phages.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nPhage Classification Tool Set (PHACTS) utilizes a novel similarity algorithm and\na supervised Random Forest classifier to make a prediction whether the lifestyle\nof a phage, described by its proteome, is virulent or temperate. The similarity \nalgorithm creates a training set from phages with known lifestyles and along with\nthe lifestyle annotation, trains a Random Forest to classify the lifestyle of a\nphage. PHACTS predictions are shown to have a 99% precision rate. \n\nTo install `PHACTS`,\n```\npip install phacts\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\n git clone https://github.com/deprekate/PHACTS.git\n pip install PHACTS/ --user\n```\n\nThis is the new python based recoding of my original perl code, and is in an alpha state for now.\n* I have included fasta35 binaries for Linux and OSX, that should install automatically.  For \nWindows, you will need to download a windows fasta35 binary, and make it visible on the PATH\n\nI have tried to replicate exactly the functionality of the original published version.  \n\nPHACTS Example\n--------------\n\nRun on included sample data, the output is the predicted lifestyle and the class probabilities:\n```sh\n$ phacts.py tests/NC_001416.faa \nClass       probability  standard deviation\nTemperate   0.626273726  0.101584648\n```\n"
