Predicted prophages will help to fill the gaps in the current sparse phage sequence space, which should cover an estimated 100 million species. Systematic and reliable predictions will enable further studies of prophages contribution to the bacteriophage gene pool and to better understand gene shuffling between prophages and phages infecting the same host.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nSoftare is available at http://aclame.ulb.ac.be/prophinder",
