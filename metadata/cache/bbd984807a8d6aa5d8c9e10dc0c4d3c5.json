A web portal is also available (http://seeker.pythonanywhere.com/).\n\nIf you have any trouble installing or using Seeker, please let us know by opening an issue on GitHub or emailing us \n(either ayal.gussow@gmail.com or noamaus@gmail.com).\n\n<em>Note</em>: Seeker relies on tensorflow, which is not yet supported in python 3.8. Therefore, to use\nSeeker you need to use Python 3.6 or 3.7. Creating different Python environments is easy using conda \n(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n \n\n## Citation\n[1]Noam Auslander*, Ayal B. Gussow1*#, Sean Benler, Yuri I. Wolf, Eugene V.

From a terminal, run:\n\n`pip install seeker` \n\nThis will install Seeker and all of its dependencies.\n\n## Installation using Conda\nConda provides an easy method to install Seeker. First, install conda or miniconda\n(https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).\n\nThen run the following commands to install seeker:\n```\nconda create --name seeker python=3.7 pip\nconda activate seeker\npip install seeker\n```\n\n<em>Note</em>: If you rely on conda, any time you want to use Seeker's libraries or commands you have to first run:\n```\nconda activate seeker\n```\n\n## Usage\nThe Seeker library consists of binaries that can be run from the command line and a python library that\ncan be incorporated into Python scripts.\n\n### Binaries\nSeeker includes a binary that predicts whether an entire sequence is bacterial or phage.\n\nTo predict whether sequences are bacterial or phage, run the following from the terminal:\n \n`predict-metagenome input.fa`\n\nThis will output a prediction for each sequence in `input.fa` along with Seeker's score. Scores are between 0 and 1.\nHigher scores correspond to phage predictions while lower scores correspond to bacterial predictions. Sequences with \nscores above 0.5 are predicted phages, while sequences with scores below 0.5 \nare predicted bacteria.  \n\n### Python Library\nThe primary class in the Python library is SeekerFasta. SeekerFasta can load a Fasta file and score its entries using \nSeeker. SeekerFasta has the following parameters:\n\n1. path_or_str. Either a path to a Fasta or a Fasta string. \n2. LSTM_type. Which LSTM implementation to use. Options are \"python\", \"matlab\", \"prophage\" (not recommended). Default is Matlab.\n3. seeker_model. If you've already loaded a model into a SeekerModel object and prefer to use that model, you can\nprovide it as a parameter here. Default is None, in which case the model will be loaded from file.  \n1. load_seqs. Whether to preload all Fasta sequences to memory. Default is True. \n5. is_fasta_str. Set to True if you provided a Fasta string instead of a path to a Fasta file. Default is False. \n\nOnce a Fasta is loaded, there are several functions that can be used to generate Seeker predictions.\nFor example, to predict whether the entries of a Fasta are phage or bacteria:\n```\nfrom seeker import SeekerFasta\nseeker_fasta = SeekerFasta(\"input.fa\")\npredictions = seeker_fasta.phage_or_bacteria()  # This returns a list of phage/bacteria predictions for the Fasta\nprint(\"\\n\".join(predictions))   # print predictions\n\n# To filter the Fasta file for predicted phage sequences, the following will\n# create a new fasta and save it to \"seeker_phage_contigs.fa\" with all sequences with \n# a Seeker score of 0.5 and above (threshold can be adjusted per user goals)\nseeker_fasta.meta2fasta(out_fasta_path=\"seeker_phage_contigs.fa\", threshold=0.5)\n```\n\nAlternatively, to predict prophages:\n```\nseeker_fasta = SeekerFasta(\"input.fa\", LSTM_type=\"prophage\")\nseeker_fasta.save2bed(\"output.bed\")  # Save prophage coordinates to BED file\nseeker_fasta.save2fasta(\"output.fa\")  # Save prophage sequences to Fasta file \n```\n<em>NOTE</em>: Seeker was not trained to predict prophages. The prophage model is the output of the first training step, that has been described in [1]. This model has not been tested thoroughly for prophage prediction, and its performance is affected by the prophage prediction parameters which depend on the organism and the user's goals. Due to this, the use of this model for prophage detection is not recommended, unless it is done as an initial filtering step. \n \n## LSTM Models\nThe LSTM models can be found in the `models` directory. \n1. model.h5. Metagenome LSTM model, trained in python using Keras.\n1. MatModel0.h5. Metagenome LSTM model, trained in matlab.\n1. MatModePRO.h5. Prophage LSTM model, trained in matlab.\n\n## Datasets \nTraining, validation and test datasets are available from:\nftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/wolf/_suppl/Seeker/\n\n## Contact\nIf you run into any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue on Github or email us \nat either ayal.gussow@gmail.com or noamaus@gmail.com.\n"
