  "data": "# The VIRION database\n\n![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/viralemergence/virion/main)\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20license-MIT-green)\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data%20license-CC--0-brightgreen)\n\nVIRION is an atlas of the vertebrate-virus network, maintained by [Verena](https://www.viralemergence.org/), an NSF Biology Integration Institute. \nThe development of the VIRION database through 2022 is documented [here](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02985-21); as we work to transition to a new platform, an interim changelog can also be found below.\nWe strongly encourage researchers to read both the _mBio_ publication and this README file before using these data.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Several known taxonomic errors exist in the data. \n> These are documented in the issues on this repository, and we encourage users to add new issues as appropriate.\n> Major changes to viral taxonomy, such as the switch to binomial nomenclature as described by ICTV and [adopted by NCBI](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2025/04/25/ncbi-taxonomy-updates-virus-classification-april-2025/), may not be reflected in all instances.\n> Finally, users should be cautious about interpretation of the data, and consult the manuscript for guidance about how to handle some of VIRION's unique features, such as a mix of evidentiary standards.\n\n## How to get VIRION\n\nThe code for producing the virion data set can be found in this repository. \nSee the [reproducing virion wiki](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/wiki/Reproducing-Virion) for details.\n\nThe easiest way to get the data is to use the [virionData R package](https://viralemergence.github.io/virionData/), the [py-virion-data package](https://pypi.org/project/py-virion-data/) or\ndownload it from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15643003) .\n\nCurrently, all large files are compressed in .csv.gz format to minimize storage requirements. \nThese files are comma delimited with period decimal separators. \nThe data can be unzipped using tools such as the `vroom` R package or the `CSV.jl` Julia library.\nFor more information about using specific versions of the code or data, see the [code versioning](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/wiki/Development-process#releases---code-versioning) or\n[data versioning](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/wiki/Data-Versioning) sections of the wiki.\n\n\n## How to use VIRION\n\n### Citing VIRION\n\nIf you use VIRION for your research, please:\n1. Cite the publication: Carlson CJ, Gibb RJ, Albery GF, Brierley L, Connor R, Dallas T, Eskew EA, Fagre AC, Farrell MJ, Frank HK, Muylaert RL, Poisot T, Rasmussen AL, Ryan SJ, Seifert SN. The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION): an Atlas of Vertebrate-Virus Associations. mBio. 2022 Mar 1. DOI: 10.1128/mbio.02985-21.\n2. Cite the version of the data you used. In R `virionData::get_citation(zenodo_id = \"ZENODO_ID_FOR_VERSION\", style = \"apa\")`. In python `deposit.get_citation(style = \"apa\",zenodo_id = \"ZENODO_ID_FOR_VERSION\" )`.\n3. Include the following statement in your acknowledgements: \"This project was supported by the Verena data ecosystem, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF DBI 2213854).\"\n \nIf necessary (e.g., for specific journal requirements), you can also cite the VIRION codebase itself using this DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/319686363.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/319686363).\n\n### Code and data licenses\n\nThe code in this repository is covered by an LGPL3 license. \nThis is a copy left license that requires anyone redistributing this code to \ninclude an LGPL3 license for that portion of the code base.  \n\nCheckout the full license language here: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/\n\nVIRION data is currently distributed under a ODbL-1.0 license.\nAs such, you can do just about anything with it that you'd like.\nIf you reproduce and re-distribute the data, you must include an equivalent share-a-like license.\nIf you place the data behind an authentication portal or paywall, you must also share a freely available version.\n\nCheck out the full license language for the data here: https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/\n\n\n## How VIRION works\n\nThe VIRION database is periodically re-compiled from two static sources (CLOVER and PREDICT) and one dynamic source (GenBank). If you want to reproduce the vignettes we present in the publication, you can also download the entire release of [version 0.2.1](https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/releases/tag/v0.2.1-beta).\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n\n%% Nodes\n    GMPD2(\"GMPD2\")\n    HP3(\"HP3\")\n    Shaw(\"Shaw\")\n    EID2(\"EID2 (2015)\")\n\n    RECON1(\"\n**Reconciliation 1**\n\u2022 names reconciled to NCBI taxonomy\n\u2022 temporal and sampling metadata standardized\n\u2022 manual curation of unmatched names\n\")\n\n    style RECON1 text-align:left, fill:#efefef, stroke:#a0a0a0;\n    style RECON2 text-align:left, fill:#efefef, stroke:#a0a0a0;\n\n    CLOVER(\"CLOVER\")\n\n    GenBank(\"fa:fa-arrows-spin GenBank\")\n\n    PREDICT(\"fa:fa-box-archive PREDICT\")\n\n    RECON2(\"**Reconciliation 2**\n\u2022 update of dynamic datasets (GenBank)\n\u2022 names reconciled to NCBI and ICTV\n\u2022 additional quality checks\n\u2022 community sourcing for validation\n\")\n\n\n    subgraph virion[**Virion flat files**]\n        Virion[\"fa:fa-file-zipper Virion.csv.gz\"]\n        Edgelist[\"fa:fa-table Edgelist.csv\"]\n        TaxonomyHost[\"fa:fa-table TaxonomyHost.csv\"]\n        TaxonomyVirus[\"fa:fa-table TaxonomyVirus.csv\"]\n        Provenance[\"fa:fa-file-zipper Provenance.csv.gz\"]\n        Detection[\"fa:fa-file-zipper Detection.csv.gz\"]\n        Temporal[\"fa:fa-file-zipper Temporal.csv.gz\"]\n        direction TB\n        Edgelist --> Virion\n        TaxonomyHost --> Virion\n        TaxonomyVirus --> Virion\n        Provenance --> Virion\n        Detection --> Virion\n        Temporal --> Virion\n    end\n\n    style virion stroke:#a0a0a0, fill:#efefef;\n\n%% Edge connections between nodes\n    GMPD2 --> RECON1;\n    HP3 --> RECON1;\n    Shaw --> RECON1;\n    EID2 --> RECON1;\n    RECON1 --> CLOVER;\n\n    CLOVER --> RECON2;\n    GenBank --> RECON2;\n    PREDICT --> RECON2;\n\n    RECON2 --> virion;\n\n%% Individual node styling.
