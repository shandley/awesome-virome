It is a spin-off of [FAVITES](https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES) that is designed to be much simpler and faster, but at the expense of reduced flexibility. FAVITES-Lite was designed to incorporate the just key functionality of FAVITES that most users require. In general, we strongly recommend using FAVITES-Lite instead of FAVITES for epidemic simulation projects.\n\n## Installation\nFAVITES-Lite is written in Python and depends on the following Python packages:\n\n* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)\n* [TreeSAP](https://github.com/niemasd/treesap)\n* [TreeSwift](https://github.com/niemasd/TreeSwift)\n\nFAVITES-Lite also calls many command-line tools, which must be installed in your `PATH`:\n\n* [CoaTran](https://github.com/niemasd/CoaTran)\n* [GEMF_FAVITES](https://github.com/niemasd/GEMF)\n* [NiemaGraphGen](https://github.com/niemasd/NiemaGraphGen)\n* [Seq-Gen](https://github.com/rambaut/Seq-Gen)\n\nTo install FAVITES-Lite itself, you can either download the latest [release](https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES-Lite/releases), or you can clone this GitHub repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES-Lite.git\n```\n\nFAVITES-Lite is also available on [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/favites_lite/README.html). Assuming you have already installed `conda` (or equivalent) and added the `bioconda` channel, you can install FAVITES-Lite as well as all of its dependencies as follows:\n\n```bash\nconda install favites_lite\n```\n\nFor convenience, you can also use the [FAVITES-Lite Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/favites_lite), or you can refer to the [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES-Lite/blob/main/Dockerfile#L9-L42) for installation commands.\n\n## Usage\nThere are two primary components to FAVITES-Lite: the [Config Designer](https://niema.net/FAVITES-Lite) and the [FAVITES-Lite executable](favites_lite.py).\n\n### Config Designer\nThe [Config Designer](https://niema.net/FAVITES-Lite) is a tool that helps users design a FAVITES-Lite configuration file for their unique simulation experiment design. Unlike the original FAVITES, in which users had to navigate the documentation to manually design a configuration file, the FAVITES-Lite Config Designer guides the user and includes detailed information about all model choices for all steps of the simulation workflow.\n\nThe Config Designer web app was developed by my students: [Grant Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-cheng-52171b205/), [Jenny Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwny/), Justyce Granda, Kathy Chen, [Helena Hundhausen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-hundhausen), and [Daniel Ji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielji26).\n\n### FAVITES-Lite Executable\nThe [FAVITES-Lite executable (`favites_lite.py`)](favites_lite.py) actually executes a given simulation experiment, and it can be used as follows:\n\n```\nusage: favites_lite.py [-h] -c CONFIG -o OUTPUT [--overwrite] [--quiet] [--version]\n\n  -h, --help                   show this help message and exit\n  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG   FAVITES-Lite Config File\n  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT   Output Directory\n  --overwrite                  Overwrite output directory if it exists (default: False)\n  --quiet                      Suppress Log Messages (default: False)\n  --version                    Show FAVITES-Lite version (default: False)\n```\n\n## Scripts\nTo aid with common downstream analyses, you can find some helper scripts in the [`scripts`](scripts) folder of this repository. The scripts will be organized by step(s) of the FAVITES-Lite simulation workflow, and each subdirectory will have a README describing the scripts in that folder.\n\n# Citing FAVITES-Lite\nIf you use FAVITES-Lite in your work, please cite:\n\n> **Moshiri N** (2025). \"Scalable Epidemic Simulation Using FAVITES-Lite.\" In: Muley, V.Y.
