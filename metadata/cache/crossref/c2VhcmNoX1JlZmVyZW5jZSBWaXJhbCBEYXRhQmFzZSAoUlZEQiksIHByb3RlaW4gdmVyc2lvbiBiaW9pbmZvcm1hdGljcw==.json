Please find below our line-by-line responses.  \n<b>The database is described as facilitating sequence assignation. This seems a bit vague, a sentence describing possible applications could help.</b>  We have added the following sentence to exemplify possible applications: \u201cWhen trying to characterize sequences present in a metagenomics sample, searching first for related sequences in a viral database can lead to identify rapidly a known virus (high identity between the query sequence and the one in the database), or identify potential new species (low identity with any known sequence). Such hits must be further characterized on more comprehensive databases to increase the robustness of taxonomic assignations.\u201d  \n<b>The introduction may describe better the current state of research in the field. UniProtKB should be cited in \u201cexisting databases\u201d for viral proteins, and authors may add citations of its use in virus detection. (ex: UniRef90 used with success to create synthetic human virome1 (PMID: 26045439)). This would also highlight new potential applications for RVDB-prot. UniProtKB provides data for 3,972,271 viral proteins, a bit more than RVDB-Prot (3,899,699). RVDB-prot data is based similarity gathering of sequences with viral RefSeq, which has the advantage to ignore any taxonomical issues. On the other hand, many RefSeq are provisional, and those are not free or errors. The authors may discuss the advantage of their method over existing protein dataset.</b>  We have updated the introduction, introducing UniProtKB viral sequences: \u201cUniProtKB11 contains numerous viral sequences (: 4 497 049 in total, including 17 008 (0.38%) reviewed ones) that could, as for NCBI/nr, increase computation time when thousands of sequences have to be analyzed concomitantly, which is routinely practiced in metagenomics analyses.\u201d We have also updated the description of RefSeq (with updated contents) and better exemplified the benefit of RVDB over these two databases.  \n<b>Similarly, UniRef90 contains 577,105 clusters of proteins, which could be compared to the 489,207 unique proteins of RVDB-prot. Further discussion may help understanding the advantages of these two datasets.</b>  We stressed on the first asset of RVDB: the curation that is done on the sequences is unique and allows to raise confidence in the fact that all the sequences of the database are real viral sequences.  \n<b>The paper could provide more details on parameters used for defining clusters with Silix.</b>  Done. We used the default parameters of Silix.  \n<b>The naming system may be perfected. Although imaginative and automatic, it seems to be limited. For example cluster 77 in the -prot-hmm-txt.zip (v 15.1) contains 398 sequences, which are obviously rep proteins for ssDNA viruses circo, gemini and their satellites, but the names fished out by author\u2019s method are not clear. This can be problematic for sequence assignation. Actually, the name used to create RVDB-pro keywords is not clearly defined. The name of GenBank protein entry are not very consistent and this may explain these problems. Maybe using pfam or any other method of identification over the clusters may help naming them in a more consistent way.</b>  We are grateful for this remark which helped us make the naming system clear. Indeed, the pipeline does now query PFAM to annotate sequences. As explained in the new version of the manuscript, for each cluster, we query PFAM with every sequences of this cluster, using --cut_ga option of HMMER (this option makes HMMER trust PFAM GA bitscore cutoff defined for each cluster). We kept the original system (using sequences descriptions) despite the fact they are inaccurate, since sometimes, we do not find homologs clusters in PFAM.",

Parameters are now specified in the new version of the manuscript. Actually, for both of these programs, we use default parameters.  \n<b>Why is it required to locally translate the Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) from the original RVDB nucleotide database instead of downloading them from the resource?</b>  We have clarified this point in the new version: actually, we use translations provided in the entry of each nucleic sequence. They are provided in the raw data of the original database (Genbank, RefSeq) along with the accession number. What we do amounts to retrieve all protein sequences corresponding to a nucleic sequence from protein database with accession numbers, but doing it directly from the nucleic database is faster.  \n<b>I have a question for the taxonomic assignation to the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) when building the clusters. How are handled the possible contradictions within a cluster? More exactly, what is done exactly if sequences that belong to distantly related taxa are clustered together? If a strict LCA rule is applied, then it would be possible to have a really inprecise assignation (something like &quot;virus&quot; and that's it).</b>  Indeed, we use na&iuml;ve LCA assignation, and it can lead to imprecise assignation (some clusters can be tagged as Viruses). As we do not have other information about the cluster we characterize, we chose not to avoid this possibility. We have added a precision about this case in the new version of the manuscript: \u201cFor each cluster, the taxonomic information is summarized by a Last Common Ancestor (LCA) that corresponds to the taxon in the tree of life to which all the sequence taxa belong; \n<u>this LCA can be close to the root of the tree (Viruses), but is usually specific to a family</u>.\u201d",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To facilitate bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data for the detection of both known and novel viruses, we have developed a new reference viral database (RVDB) that provides a broad representation of different virus species from eukaryotes by including all viral, virus-like, and virus-related sequences (excluding bacteriophages), regardless of their size. In particular, RVDB contains endogenous nonretroviral elements, endogenous retroviruses, and retrotransposons. Sequences were clustered to reduce redundancy while retaining high viral sequence diversity. A particularly useful feature of RVDB is the reduction of cellular sequences, which can enhance the run efficiency of large transcriptomic and genomic data analysis and increase the specificity of virus detection.</jats:p>",

The Golm Metabolome Database for metabolite data (GMD) represents one such effort to make these data broadly available and to interconnect the different molecular levels of a biological system [1]. As data interpretation in the light of already existing data becomes increasingly important, these initiatives are an essential part of current and future systems biology.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>A mass spectral library consisting of experimentally derived tryptic peptide product ion spectra was generated based on liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS). Protein samples derived from <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardii</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Medicago truncatula</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</jats:italic> were analysed. With currently 4,557 manually validated spectra associated with 4,226 unique peptides from 1,367 proteins, the database serves as a continuously growing reference data set and can be used for protein identification and quantification in uncharacterized biological samples. For peptide identification, several algorithms were implemented based on a recently published study for peptide mass fingerprinting [2] and tested for false positive and negative rates. An algorithm which considers intensity distribution for match correlation scores was found to yield best results. For proof of concept, an LC-IT-MS analysis of a tryptic leaf protein digest was converted to mzData format and searched against the mass spectral library. The utility of the mass spectral library was also tested for the identification of phosphorylated tryptic peptides. We included <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> phosphorylation sites of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> proteins and the identification performance was found to be improved compared to genome-based search algorithms. Protein identification by ProMEX is linked to other levels of biological organization such as metabolite, pathway, and transcript data.

The database allows text searches based on metadata such as experimental information of the samples, mass spectrometric instrument parameters or unique protein identifier like AGI codes. ProMEX integrates proteomics data with other levels of molecular organization including metabolite, pathway, and transcript information and may thus become a useful resource for plant systems biology studies. The ProMEX mass spectral library is available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

The effective and suitable vaccine to treat the MARV virus is not commercialized in public and demands rigorously tested on several scales. This research used a CADD (Computer-Aided Drug Design) computational based technology to find novel drug-like compounds that could inhibit the replicating of the VP40. The pharmacophoric features bases screening was done using an online computational based software, \u201cZINC Pharmer\u201d. We retrieved about 32456 compounds mainly focused on the properties of pharmacophores from the ZINC database. Lipinski\u2019s rule was also used to predict these drug-like compounds. as well as molecular coupling-dependent screening and selection of VP40 screening ligand complexes based on S-rank (lower than reference) and value of root, mean square (RMSD) (bottom) to examine for reference) using the Molecular Working Environment (MOE) machine. As a result, 100 compounds were found to have a close interaction with MARV VP40, followed by the Binding energy (BE) analysis of these 100 compounds. Only 50 were the strongest binding energy than favipiravir [reference inhibitor] after using the MOE-LigX algorithm to compare their binding energy. After that, ADMET analysis predicted only five compounds (ZINC95457352, ZINC38752258, ZINC38752253, ZINC39272175, and ZINC38752377) passed the ADMET parameters and have the strongest inhibitory effect against the MARV\u2019s VP40. It has been suggested that these \u201cdrug-like\u201d candidates have an increased ability to inhibit MARV replication, leading to treatment of MARVD.</jats:p>",
