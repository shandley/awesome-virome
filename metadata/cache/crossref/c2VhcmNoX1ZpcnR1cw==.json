The section deals with <italic>virtus</italic> in both the prologues and discusses how the thematic variations between the two relate to the different historical narratives. Finally, through a close analysis of the corruption of <italic>logos</italic> in the text, it explores how Sallust\u2019s creation of a \u2018vocabulary of decline\u2019 and the devaluation of language illustrate the moving boundaries of the moral and political behaviour of the main historical characters.</p>",

By identifying what was essential to Roman <italic>virtus</italic> and what was superfluous and susceptible to change, Tacitus illustrates how, even though a certain degree of political freedom was lost, there were some Romans who could exercise a more \u2018personal\u2019 freedom which led to new manifestations of <italic>virtus</italic>. Tacitus\u2019 perception of the nature of political change is one of the main themes used throughout the chapter to plot the barriers that <italic>virtus</italic> had to overcome in the new world of the principate.</p>",

The central questions of this study are addressed: a) why was\u00a0virtus\u00a0so important to the Roman historians? and b) what role does political change play in the (re)definition of the concept of\u00a0virtus\u00a0and also in the development of its expression in practice? It also discusses how and why the Roman historians, who saw historiography as an account of the life and mores [cf. Livy, Praef. 9] of the Roman people through time, made morality a valid category for explaining their past, and why, therefore, the analysis of the concept of virtus through their narratives is a sound way of approaching Roman historical writing.</p>",

It also provides comparisons with its Greek parallels andreia and arete, and a brief assessment of the influence of Greek philosophy on Roman thought, Stoicism in particular, regarding virtus. The two main meanings of virtus are explained through the concepts of virilis-virtus (courage) and humana-virtus (virtue) and show the particular connections between virtus and Roman politics. Cicero holds a particularly important place in this chapter, as the creator of a nomenclature and vocabulary that offer an adequate rationalization of the concept of virtus.</p>",
