Such noncanonical RNAP activities are biologically significant, serving RNA pathogens such as hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and contributing to cellular gene regulation. Despite the broad biological implications of these processes, our understanding of the underlying RNAP mechanisms remains incomplete. Using E. coli RNAP, a multi-subunit RNAP, as a model, we describe here the general RNA-templated RNA extension activity of that enzyme. Our data argue that the 3' end of an added RNA template can fold back and pair with upstream bases in the template, creating an intramolecular primer-template duplex as short as 1-2 base pairs. The RNAP then extends this intramolecular duplex, incorporating nucleotides complementary to the template. RNA-templated RNA extension occurred in minutes and did not appear to be suppressed by the presence of a promoter-containing DNA template. Excepting oligonucleotides implicitly designed to prevent any possibility of 3' end self-priming, every RNA template we tested could be extended by the enzyme, highlighting the general nature of this reaction. These data define a general activity of a cellular RNAP. Unrestricted, this activity could contribute to emergence and replication of RNA-based agents such as HDV and viroids; if highly regulated, the activity could limit these same elements.</jats:p>",

More recently, this has expanded beyond investigations of independent single modifications, revealing the breadth of modification complexities in single transcripts and the biogenesis pathways involved that lead to coordinately modified RNA species. This has resulted in the concept of modification circuits, where one modification can promote or inhibit the subsequent installation of other modifications, or when modifications are coordinated across different RNA species. These circuits play important roles in the biogenesis of multi-stepped post-transcriptional modifications, modulate ribonucleoprotein complex formation and conformational switches, and mediate codon-biased translation through the coordination of mRNA and tRNA modifications. Here, I review evidence of complex modification circuits in mRNA and noncoding RNA and highlight open questions concerning the molecular mechanisms giving rise to modification circuits and their importance in the context of RNA processing and maturation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most basic tasks of every cell is the synthesis of ribosomes, yet the process is so complex that we are only beginning to comprehend it. In human cells, the final product contains four RNAs and 79 proteins forming a large ribonucleoprotein, the ribosome. About twice as many factors are involved in assembly of these protein synthesizing machines. Additionally, some 200 small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) function in the modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) at a similar number of ribonucleotides. Modification is essential for proper function and biogenesis of ribosomes (Decatur and Fournier 2002; Sloan et al. 2016). While abrogation of individual modifications has little to no measurable effects, removal of a combination of modifications or of all causes severe to lethal effects. Modifications mostly cluster around the functional centers of the ribosome and some modifications are important for ribosome assembly. The subject of this perspective is to raise awareness to how modification at so many sites can be achieved while the pre-rRNA is being processed, folded and re-folded, and assembled with ribosomal proteins to yield the pre-ribosomal subunits in the nucleolus (Ba\u00dfler and Hurt 2019). This is not a comprehensive review but a simplification of complex issues providing access to the general reader.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Neisseria meningitidis minimal ProQ is a global RNA binding protein belonging to the family of FinO-domain proteins. The N. meningitidis ProQ consists only of the FinO domain accompanied by short N- and C-terminal extensions. To better understand how this minimal FinO-domain protein recognizes RNAs, we compared its binding to seven different natural RNA ligands of this protein. Next, two of these RNAs, rpmG-3' and AniS, were subject to further mutational studies. The data showed that N. meningitidis ProQ binds the lower part of the intrinsic transcription terminator hairpin, and that the single-stranded sequences on the 5' and 3' side of terminator stem are required for tight binding. However, the specific lengths of 5' and 3' RNA sequences required for optimal binding differed between the two RNAs. Additionally, our data show that the 2'-OH and 3'-OH groups of the 3' terminal ribose contribute to RNA binding by N. meningitidis ProQ. In summary, the minimal ProQ protein from N. meningitidis has generally similar requirements for RNA binding as the isolated FinO domains of other proteins of this family, but differs from them in detailed RNA features that are optimal for specific RNA recognition.</jats:p>",
