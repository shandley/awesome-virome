During onychokeratinization, these cells undergo progressive flattening and produce high levels of hard, disulfide cross-linked keratins (Eckhart et al., 2024) that form the rigid, compact nail plate. Unlike epidermal keratinocytes, onychocytes are firmly integrated into the nail plate and do not desquamate. |\n| thyroid follicular cell (CL:0002258) | A cell type that varies from squamous to columnar, depending on their activity with microvillus directed luminally. This cell produces and secretes thyroid hormones. |                  An epithelial cell that is part of the thyroid follicle epithelium, with a shape that ranges from squamous when inactive to cuboidal or columnar when active, reflecting its hormonal activity. Its apical surface is lined with microvilli projecting into the colloid-filled lumen, where it synthesizes, stores, and secretes the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), releasing them into the bloodstream in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). |\n| keratinocyte (CL:0000312) | An epidermal cell which synthesizes keratin and undergoes a characteristic change as it moves upward from the basal layers of the epidermis to the cornified (horny) layer of the skin. Successive stages of differentiation of the keratinocytes forming the epidermal layers are basal cell, spinous or prickle cell, and the granular cell. |                  An epithelial cell of stratified squamous tissues, including skin, oral mucosa (Hiroshima et al., 2011), and esophagus (Whelan et al., 2018), that produces keratin proteins and secretes antimicrobial peptides to form a resilient barrier against environmental damage, dehydration, pathogens, and microbial invasion. It undergoes successive stages of differentiation marked by changes in keratin expression, supporting tissue integrity, wound repair, and contributing to immune defense. |</p>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;details&gt;\n&lt;summary&gt;Nodes added to subset: 6&lt;/summary&gt;</p>\n<p>| Term | Subset |\n----|----|\n| hematopoietic cell (CL:0000988) | general_cell_types_upper_slim |\n| connective tissue cell (CL:0002320) | general_cell_types_upper_slim |\n| endothelial cell (CL:0000115) | general_cell_types_upper_slim |\n| muscle cell (CL:0000187) | general_cell_types_upper_slim |\n| neural cell (CL:0002319) | general_cell_types_upper_slim |\n| prostate gland microvascular endothelial cell (CL:2000059) | human_reference_atlas |</p>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;details&gt;\n&lt;summary&gt;Nodes obsoleted without replacement: 1&lt;/summary&gt;</p>\n<p>| Term |\n----|\n| obsolete non-terminally differentiated cell (CL:0000055) |</p>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;details&gt;\n&lt;summary&gt;Synonyms removed: 2&lt;/summary&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2922 class hierarchy terminally differentiated cells by @JABelfiore in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3114</li>\n<li>Fixed #3139 - Terms for Keratinocytes and subclasses by @Caroline-99 in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3167</li>\n<li>Add 'only in taxon' constraints to human-specific CL terms to exclude them from mouse_subset by @Copilot in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3198</li>\n<li>Whole mouse brain ontology added as component by @hkir-dev in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3169</li>\n<li>Fixes #3161 logical and textual def- thyroid cell terms by @Caroline-99 in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3166</li>\n<li>Restore stato_terms.txt file by @hkir-dev in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3209</li>\n<li>Add new cell type: monocyte-derived Kupffer cell (CL:4072015) by @Copilot in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3184</li>\n<li>Update onychocyte textual definition with enhanced scientific description and new references by @Copilot in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3202</li>\n<li>Add onychofibroblast term (CL_4052062) by @Copilot in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3200</li>\n<li>Fixes #3087 Update general cell types upper slim subset by @aleixpuigb in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3197</li>\n<li>adding claude by @cmungall in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3185</li>\n<li>Fix germinal center B cell logical definition to include all germinal centers by @Copilot in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3211</li>\n<li>Addresses #2785 Automatically pull in HuBMAP 2D images by @aleixpuigb in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/2805</li>\n<li>Replace obsolete SSSOM/T-OWL rule. by @gouttegd in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3213</li>\n<li>Addresses #3162 Create 120 terms for PNS neurons by @aleixpuigb in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3205</li>\n<li>refresh imports for CL release by @Caroline-99 in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3214</li>\n<li>Remove 2DFTU_HRA_illustrations and PNS_neurons subsets by @aleixpuigb in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3216</li>\n<li>CL release 30-07-2025 by @Caroline-99 in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3217</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Copilot made their first contribution in https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/3198</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/compare/2025-06-20...v2025-07-30</p>",

The context includes the Ribbentrop&ndash;Molotov Pact, the dismantling of Czechoslovakia, and the cession of Southern Dobruja. This review, written by the prominent Academic Viorica Moisuc, underlines the documentary richness and analytical strength of the monograph and recognizes the author&rsquo;s original contribution to the historiography of Eastern European international relations. The book stands as a key academic reference in the field of 20th-century diplomacy and border politics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\ud83d\udd11 <strong>Keywords :</strong></h3>\n<p>Romania, Bulgaria, Dobruja, Treaty of Craiova, World War II diplomacy, geopolitical crisis, revisionism, Ribbentrop&ndash;Molotov Pact, Romanian foreign policy, Bulgarian foreign policy, Napoca Star,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Costea, Romanian&ndash;Bulgarian Political-Diplomatic Relations (1938&ndash;1940)</strong><br>Cluj-Napoca, Napoca Star Publishing House, 2010, 476 pages.</p>\n<p>The subject of Maria Costea&rsquo;s book addresses a theme that has been little or only tangentially examined by Romanian and international historiography, and where numerous errors, subjective interpretations, and scholarly controversies persist in international academic discourse.</p>\n<p>In conducting this research, the author demonstrated the utmost rigor in uncovering historical truth, based on archival documents, memoir literature, and Romanian, Bulgarian, and Western historiography, as well as the press of the time. The book originates from Maria Costea&rsquo;s doctoral thesis, defended at the &ldquo;Ovidius&rdquo; University of Constan\u021ba (Faculty of History and Political Science), and awarded the highest grade.</p>\n<p>From the outset, I emphasize that the work, as a whole, represents an original and valuable contribution to understanding Romanian&ndash;Bulgarian political-diplomatic relations during a period of unprecedented European political crisis. Romania remained the only country in Central Europe with its borders intact, despite immense threats emerging from the East, West, and South. During the analyzed period, several major European states disappeared one after another from the map: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France. On June 22, 1940, France&mdash;the principal ally of Romania&mdash;was removed from the war, and Britain, in turn, was under threat from the Nazi war machine.</p>\n<p>In this precarious international context, when Romania was entirely isolated due to the Ribbentrop&ndash;Molotov Pact, its foreign policy attempted a difficult balancing act to delay the revision of its national borders in favor of the USSR, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and to slow the complete economic takeover by the Nazi Reich.</p>\n<p>Romanian&ndash;Bulgarian political-diplomatic relations evolved along specific lines determined by the territorial changes occurring in Central Europe between 1938&ndash;1939. In this evolution, the positions of the USSR and Germany were decisive factors in Bulgaria&rsquo;s foreign policy. The severing of Southern Dobruja in the summer of 1940 was the direct consequence of the shift in international power following the German&ndash;Soviet agreement, which reached its peak in August 1939.</p>\n<p>Attention must be drawn to the introductory study of this work, focused on analyzing the Romanian and Bulgarian historiography related to the subject, which constitutes a substantial essay&mdash;unusual for doctoral theses&mdash;and all the more valuable for it.</p>\n<p>The book is structured into twelve chapters, preceded by an &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; and followed by &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bibliography.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The evolution of Romanian&ndash;Bulgarian relations is examined with professionalism not only on the political and diplomatic levels but also with respect to cultural, ecclesiastical, and social issues&mdash;each of great interest (Chapter I). Step by step, the author presents how Bulgarian revisionism asserted itself more vigorously as a consequence of Yugoslavia&rsquo;s internal fractures and the weakening of the cohesion of the Balkan Entente following the Anschluss and, most notably, after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia (Chapters II and III). The author introduces numerous previously unknown documents, and her polemical spirit is effectively employed, with strong arguments, whenever erroneous theses appear in Bulgarian historiography.</p>\n<p>The influence of the USSR&rsquo;s aggressive revisionist policy, especially after the signing of the Ribbentrop&ndash;Molotov Pact, is revealed in a new and much more complex light through the judicious analysis conducted in Chapters IV and V. Without a doubt, in this complex web of issues, Romania&rsquo;s foreign policy&mdash;still attempting to draw Bulgaria closer to the Balkan Entente, or ultimately into a neutral Balkan bloc&mdash;offers new data and insights that enhance our understanding of the matter (Chapter VI).</p>\n<p>The direct involvement of the Axis powers and the USSR in supporting Bulgaria&rsquo;s territorial claims against Romania is presented within the context of wartime events, but also in connection with Hungary&rsquo;s revisionist ambitions regarding Transylvania (Chapter VII).</p>\n<p>Chapters VIII, IX, and X are directly focused on the issue of Romania&rsquo;s cession of Southern Dobruja, bringing in a wealth of new data and offering a detailed analysis that fully clarifies the final blow dealt to the Romanian unitary state by Bulgaria and its allies. The analysis of the Treaty of Craiova and its implementation (Chapters XI and XII) concludes this valuable doctoral thesis, which presents in its full scope a difficult topic&mdash;politically, economically, and strategically intertwined&mdash;and one previously understood only superficially and unilaterally.</p>\n<p>At the end of these brief observations, I note with satisfaction the realization of a book of indisputable value, one that deserves translation into an international language.</p>\n<p>I consider that Maria Costea&rsquo;s book, entitled <em>Romanian&ndash;Bulgarian Political-Diplomatic Relations (1938&ndash;1940)</em>, fully meets the criteria of a scientifically rigorous academic work. It is a reference book in the field and establishes the author as a distinguished specialist in the history of international relations.</p>\n<p><strong>Prof. Dr. Viorica Moisuc</strong><br><br></p>\n<p>Viorica MOISUC, RECENZIA LA volumul&nbsp;<strong>Maria Costea, <em>Rela\u021biile politico-diplomatice rom&acirc;no-bulgare (1938&ndash;1940)</em>, Cluj-Napoca, Napoca Star, 2010, 476 p.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Subiectul c\u0103r\u021bii Mariei Costea abordeaz\u0103 o problematic\u0103 pu\u021bin sau doar tangen\u021bial studiat\u0103 de istoriografia rom&acirc;n\u0103 \u0219i interna\u021bional\u0103, &icirc;n cadrul c\u0103reia persist\u0103 numeroase erori, interpret\u0103ri subiective \u0219i controverse \u0219tiin\u021bifice &icirc;n circuitul informa\u021bional interna\u021bional.</p>\n<p>&Icirc;n realizarea acestei cercet\u0103ri, autoarea dovede\u0219te o remarcabil\u0103 rigoare \u0219tiin\u021bific\u0103 &icirc;n descifrarea adev\u0103rului istoric, baz&acirc;ndu-se pe documente de arhiv\u0103, memorialistic\u0103, dar \u0219i pe istoriografia rom&acirc;n\u0103, bulgar\u0103 \u0219i occidental\u0103, precum \u0219i pe presa vremii.

Rom&acirc;nia era, &icirc;n 1939, singura \u021bar\u0103 din Europa Central\u0103 ale c\u0103rei frontiere r\u0103m\u0103seser\u0103 neatinse, &icirc;n ciuda presiunilor imense exercitate din Est, Vest \u0219i Sud. &Icirc;n perioada analizat\u0103, au fost eliminate de pe harta Europei state importante: Austria, Cehoslovacia, Polonia, Danemarca, Norvegia, Belgia, Olanda, Luxemburg, Fran\u021ba. La 22 iunie 1940, Fran\u021ba &mdash; principalul aliat al Rom&acirc;niei &mdash; a ie\u0219it din r\u0103zboi, iar Marea Britanie era, la r&acirc;ndul ei, amenin\u021bat\u0103 de ofensiva nazist\u0103.</p>\n<p>&Icirc;n acest context interna\u021bional extrem de fragil, c&acirc;nd Rom&acirc;nia era complet izolat\u0103 diplomatic ca urmare a Pactului Ribbentrop&ndash;Molotov, politica sa extern\u0103 s-a angajat &icirc;ntr-o ac\u021biune echilibrat\u0103, menit\u0103 s\u0103 tempereze tendin\u021bele de revizuire a frontierelor &icirc;n favoarea URSS, Ungariei \u0219i Bulgariei, precum \u0219i s\u0103 &icirc;nt&acirc;rzie capturarea &icirc;ntregii economii na\u021bionale de c\u0103tre Reich-ul nazist.</p>\n<p>Rela\u021biile politico-diplomatice rom&acirc;no-bulgare au evoluat pe coordonate specifice, determinate de schimb\u0103rile teritoriale survenite &icirc;n Europa Central\u0103 &icirc;ntre 1938&ndash;1939. Pozi\u021biile URSS \u0219i Germaniei au fost decisive &icirc;n orientarea extern\u0103 a Bulgariei. Pierderea Dobrogei de Sud, &icirc;n vara anului 1940, a fost rezultatul modific\u0103rii raportului interna\u021bional de for\u021be, &icirc;n urma conven\u021biei sovieto-germane, care a atins apogeul &icirc;n august 1939.</p>\n<p>Atrag aten\u021bia &icirc;n mod special asupra studiului introductiv al lucr\u0103rii, axat pe analiza critic\u0103 a istoriografiei rom&acirc;ne \u0219i bulgare privitoare la aceast\u0103 tem\u0103.

Desertification monitoring was analyzed for Sokoto state with the collection of MOD13Q1(250-m), MYD13Q1 (1-km) and the Vegetation Index Phenology (VIP VIPPHEN NDVI) from NASA. The Vegetation<span> Index and Phenology (VIP) global datasets were created using surface reflectance data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from 1981 to 1999 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra MOD09 surface reflectance data from 2000 to 2014.</span> The Modis MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 were used to access the vegetation index (NDVI) and Land surface temperature LST of 2010 to 2020 while the VIP VIPPHEN NDVI was used to access the NDVI of 2000. The LST of 2000 were collected from <span>The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). </span>The Modis data and the Phenology NDVI were resampled using Landsat L8 path 191 and row 51 of Sokoto state coverage and were re-projected from unknown datum to WGS1984 UTM zone 32N. The vegetation health index (VHI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Thermal condition index (TCI) were estimated. TCI for the year 2000 has the highest percentage with 56.94% which falls within the normal range, the severe range has the highest percentage with 64.62% and 59.83% for the year 2010 and 2020 respectively. This result clearly indicates a decrement in the thermal condition between 2010 and 2020.&nbsp;The VCI analysis indicates that severe drought conditions affected the highest proportion of land in 2000 (42.21%,), 2010 (42.88%) and 2020 (42%). In VHI, the abnormal stress has the highest percentage with 56.54% for 2000 while the severe stress with 41.95% and 41.92% for 2010 and 2020 respectively. <span>&nbsp;</span>The result shows that four regions of the state (Gudu, Isa &amp; Kebbe, Rabah, Tambawal &amp; Tangazar) were the most affected weather for the year with highest or lowest analysis.&nbsp;This research provides the cost-effective means by tracking trends in degradation of land revealing the most severe which is important for the implementation of timely mitigation strategies by sustainable policy makers.</span></em></p>",

The existing traffic infrastructure often fails to provide adequate priority to ambulances, resulting in delays, congestion, and increased risk of accidents during emergency responses. In densely populated urban areas, effective traffic management for ambulances is paramount to ensuring timely and efficient emergency medical response. However, existing traffic systems often struggle to accommodate emergency vehicles adequately, leading to delays that can significantly impact patient outcomes. Thus, our traffic management system model is an innovative solution that optimizes traffic flow and prioritize ambulance movement that minimizes response times and enhance emergency medical services.</span></em></p>",

Serum samples were collected from term infants at birth and analyzed using gas chromatography&ndash;tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The dataset includes quantified metabolite peak area values for 66 infants, categorized into appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA), SGA-tall, and SGA-short groups. These data were used for multivariate analyses (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis [OPLS-DA], S-plot, variable importance in projection [VIP] scores), univariate analysis (volcano plots), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and pathway enrichment analysis. Personal identifiers have been fully anonymized. This dataset supports the findings reported in the associated manuscript.</p>",
