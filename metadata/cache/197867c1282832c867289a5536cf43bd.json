        "description": "<p>The subject of this article is the transformation processes of risk management in construction development, which are carried out through the restructuring of operational architecture in enterprises and the active involvement of stakeholders in analytical and strategic decision&ndash;making procedures. The main focus is placed on identifying mechanisms for integrating risk&ndash;oriented models into the internal operational structure of development companies operating in an environment of high market turbulence, urban pressure, and technological uncertainty. The study covers both classical elements of risk management&mdash;risk assessment, analysis, monitoring, and response&mdash;and modern digital tools that enable dynamic reconfiguration of internal processes. The work explores the operational interaction between the management modules of a developer (strategic planning, construction, marketing, legal support) in the context of building a risk&ndash;resilient system. Special attention is given to the communicative context&mdash;the role of stakeholders in identifying risk zones, forming preventive scenarios, and enhancing the flexibility of responses in critical situations.<br>Purpose of the &agrave;rticle is to develop and substantiate an approach to risk management in construction development based on the transformation of internal operational systems of a company and the involvement of key stakeholders in the processes of risk analysis and decision&ndash;making. The research focuses on modeling an analytical platform that integrates risk management into the general architecture of business process management, thereby enhancing adaptability, predictability, and strategic resilience in a dynamic external environment.<br>Research Methodology employs an interdisciplinary approach that combines tools from operations management, risk science, digital analytics, and stakeholder theory. The first stage included a structural&ndash;functional analysis of the internal operational system of development companies, particularly in processes such as strategic planning, design, implementation, and post&ndash;investment project support. Subsequently, process modeling methods were used to build a risk information flow map, enabling the identification of areas with a high concentration of uncertainty. Analytical tools such as SWOT analysis were applied to identify strengths and weaknesses of the organizational structure in the context of risk management, as well as GAP analysis to reveal gaps between the current system&rsquo;s responsiveness and the desired level of risk control. Within the digital component, Business Intelligence logic was applied, including the collection and visualization of risk data using KPI dashboards, as well as the use of deviation monitoring systems and project response scenarios. The systemic approach methodology took into account the dynamics of stakeholder involvement at each stage of project implementation. The study also relies on case analyses of real Ukrainian development structures that have demonstrated successful integration of risk management into operational architecture through the digitalization of decision&ndash;making and the creation of a multi&ndash;agent environment with distributed decision&ndash;making responsibility.<br>Research Results. The outcome of the research is a model of risk&ndash;oriented operational management in the development environment, which entails comprehensive interaction between three key modules: process, analytical, and managerial. It has been shown that implementing dashboards for KPI monitoring, combined with risk visualization through analytical maps, can reduce response time to critical incidents by 35&ndash;40%. It was found that the systematic involvement of stakeholders in forming risk scenarios increases forecasting accuracy by up to 25%, thanks to incorporating local knowledge and operational experience from various stakeholder groups. An adaptive mechanism for transforming operational processes was proposed, featuring built&ndash;in response triggers that activate in case of deviations in key indicators, including deadlines, costs, construction quality, and legal risks. It was established that building interaction between analytical departments and project teams using ERP modules ensures the consistency of managerial actions and transparency in decision&ndash;making. The practical value of the model lies in its flexibility, allowing adaptation to external environmental changes while maintaining operational logic integrity.<br>Conclusions. The research concludes that effective risk management in construction development under contemporary market transformations is possible only if enterprise operational systems are synchronized with analytical risk management tools and if key stakeholders are engaged in decision&ndash;making. The developed concept of risk&ndash;oriented operational management enables not only minimizing the probability of risk events but also creating a stable organizational structure that operates in a mode of adaptive self&ndash;tuning. Importantly, digitalization of management processes is not an end in itself but serves as a tool for integrating institutional knowledge, analytical data, and environmental feedback into a unified decision&ndash;making ecosystem. The model developed within this study enables the implementation of early warning mechanisms, systematic response procedures, and proactive forecasting, which are critical for the investment&ndash;risky domain of construction development. Thus, the proposed approach contributes to the formation of strategic stability, organizational reliability, and increased trust from investors, partners, and end&ndash;users&mdash;forming the basis for long&ndash;term capitalization of real estate projects.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The subject of the study is the theoretical and methodological foundations of personnel management in modern conditions of the functioning of enterprises using digital technologies.<br>The purpose of the study is to provide a systematic theoretical and practical justification of the processes of personnel management in a sports organization and to justify the need to use digital technologies to improve the personnel management process.<br>Research methods. The article uses general scientific and special research methods, and digital methods and techniques of economic analysis, planning and forecasting (statistical, tabular, comparison, index, vertical, horizontal, modeling methods, etc.) were used in the processing and analysis of information.<br>Results of the work. As a result of the conducted research, it was shown that the dynamics of personnel management is a process of changes in approaches, methods, tools and strategies of human resource management, which reflects the adaptation of organizations to new economic, social, technological and legal conditions.<br>The modern environment of the functioning of sports organizations is undergoing significant changes, caused by both the globalization of sports and the rapid development of digital technologies and their application in the management of personnel of sports organizations. The personnel of a sports organization, which includes not only athletes, but also coaches, analysts, medical professionals, managers, plays a key role in achieving results. Managing this resource requires constant adaptation to new conditions and the use of innovative approaches.<br>The study made it possible to identify the main directions of the dynamics of personnel management of sports organizations in the digital age and assess the effectiveness of the implementation of digital solutions in the HR sphere.<br>Traditionally, HR management in the sports sector has focused on staffing the training and competition process, administrative control and contracts. However, with the development of professional sports, especially in a highly competitive environment, the importance of a strategic approach to HR management has increased: career planning, development of individual development trajectories, performance assessment, formation of a favorable microclimate in the team. Digital technologies are significantly changing traditional approaches to HR management in a sports organization. HRM systems provide centralized data storage, contract management, and performance tracking. People Analytics allows for forecasting staff turnover, the effectiveness of coaching decisions, and recovery from stress. Digital learning platforms (LMS) are used to improve staff skills, including in asynchronous mode. Sensor devices and trackers allow HR specialists and coaches to jointly analyze the physical performance of athletes and adapt training programs.<br>Field of application of the results. Economics and management of the national economy at the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels, personnel management and administration, enterprise economics.<br>Conclusions. The dynamics of personnel management in sports organizations demonstrate a clear movement towards digital transformation. HR &ndash; the service ceases to be just an administrative unit and turns into a full&ndash;fledged partner that forms the quality, stability and effectiveness of the personnel. Successful integration of digital solutions ensures the competitiveness of a sports organization at the national and international levels.<br>Based on the analysis of sports organizations, the following key trends were identified: an increase in the number of narrowly specialized specialists: the role of sports psychologists, data analysts is growing. Outsourcing of non&ndash;fundamental functions, such as accounting, media support, which allows you to focus on the sports result. Digital tools for planning personnel decisions allow you to make informed decisions regarding rotation, promotion or dismissal of personnel.<br>The results of the implementation of digital tools in the field of personnel management indicate an increase in the efficiency of the organization due to the acceleration of decision&ndash;making processes; Reduction of costs for administrative personnel services; Improving employee experience: transparent evaluation system, individualized development trajectories; Greater flexibility in managing coaching staff and administrative staff.</p>\n<p>Integrate a single digital platform that will combine medical, personnel, educational and administrative data. Increase the digital literacy of staff, in particular coaching staff. Develop a data&ndash;driven culture when making HR decisions. Invest in cybersecurity, given the sensitivity of personal and medical data of athletes.<br>From an administrative to a strategic approach &ndash; HR ceases to be just HR accounting and moves to active participation in shaping business strategy. Automation and digitalization involve the use of HRM systems (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) for real&ndash;time personnel management. Personnel analytics is the use of Big Data and artificial intelligence to predict staff turnover, employee efficiency, etc.<br>Human resource management is undergoing constant changes under the influence of technological progress, social transformations and market conditions. It is evolving from traditional administrative functions to strategic management, where digital technologies, data analytics, personnel development and an individual approach to each employee play a key role.

The performance of two advanced AI systems, ChatGPT-4 and Data Analyst, was evaluated based on their ability to generate accurate disability reports and percentage calculations for nine realistic patient scenarios. These outputs were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale, focusing on alignment with expert evaluations and established disability guidelines, completeness, and accuracy (absence of false information). The findings underscore the potential of integrating AI tools into health commission workflows to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have swiftly become essential tools across diverse applications such as automated content creation, personal writing aids, language translation, and academic writing. However LLMs also raise significant ethical and societal concerns, particularly regarding potential gender biases in the text they produce. This study investigates the presence of gender bias in four Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, Llama 2 7B, and Llama 2 13B. By generating a gendered language dataset using these LLMs, focusing on sentences about men and women that include gender-coded words from gender lexicon, we analyze the extent of gender bias in the outputs of these LLMs. Our evaluation is two-fold: we use the generated dataset to train a gender stereotype detection task and measure gender bias in the classifier, and we perform a comprehensive analysis of the LLM generated text at both the sentence and word levels. Gender bias evaluations in classification tasks and lexical content reveal that all the LLMs demonstrate significant gender bias. ChatGPT 4 and Llama 2 13B exhibit the least gender bias, with weak associations between gendered adjectives used and the gender of the person described in the sentence. In contrast, ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama 2 7B exhibit the most gender bias, showing strong associations between the gendered adjectives used and the gender of the person described in the sentence. This study underscores the need for continuous efforts to mitigate gender bias in LLMs to prevent the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes in LLM-generated texts. It also highlights the importance of cautious scrutiny when utilizing LLM-generated text in contexts sensitive to gender issues.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The purpose of this article is the process of integrating digital technologies and innovative solutions into the field of human resource management (HR management) of construction companies, taking into account the challenges of sustainable development. The main focus is on examining changes in the functional structure of HR systems under the influence of digitalization, as well as analyzing the implementation of smart technologies, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, automated recruitment platforms, and performance management systems. The impact of digital transformation on the formation of a new corporate culture, changes in leadership models, the digital identity of the employee, and the rethinking of HR&rsquo;s role as a strategic business partner is considered. Special attention is paid to how digital solutions contribute to improving the efficiency of hiring, adaptation, training, motivation, retention, and employee development. The mechanisms of the relationship between the innovativeness of HR processes and increased labor productivity, overall company competitiveness, and alignment with ESG principles (environmental, social, governance) are also analyzed. The study focuses on finding a balance between the tech&ndash;oriented nature of HR systems and the humanistic principles of human capital management in the construction sector.<br>The purpose of the article is to substantiate a conceptual approach to integrating digitalization and innovation into HR management in construction companies as one of the key mechanisms for increasing labor productivity in the context of sustainable development. Within this approach, the potential of using modern digital technologies to transform personnel management functions, optimize human resources, and create flexible, adaptive, and intellectually&ndash;oriented HR platforms is defined. The main focus is on forming a value proposition for employees through technologies that enhance interaction efficiency and support the company&rsquo;s social responsibility.<br>Research Methodology. The research methodology is based on a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach that combines the principles of the digital economy, sustainable development theory, organizational behavior, and strategic HR management. In the first stage, a structural&ndash;functional analysis of HR systems in construction companies was applied to identify key bottlenecks that hinder personnel management efficiency. A comparative description of digital human resource management tools was then conducted, including HRM systems, remote learning platforms, staff turnover prediction programs, AI&ndash;based recruitment and performance evaluation solutions. The study used a case method covering examples of digital HR platform implementation in leading construction companies in Ukraine and the EU (such as KAN Development, Skanska, Vinci Construction), as well as content analysis of corporate reporting on labor performance indicators. As part of the empirical research methods, an expert survey of HR directors and IT specialists of construction companies was conducted to identify barriers, drivers, and expectations from digital HR transformation. In addition, a social modeling method was used to simulate the impact of different digital strategies on staff productivity in the construction project environment. The results were processed using statistical analysis tools and integrated into a conceptual model of digital&ndash;innovative HR management that meets the principles of sustainable development.<br>Research Results. Within the framework of the study, a conceptual model for integrating digital innovations into HR management in construction companies was developed, based on a combination of analytical, adaptive, motivational, and strategic modules. It was established that the implementation of digital HRM solutions reduces the time for personnel search and adaptation by 30&ndash;40%, and also improves the accuracy of competency&ndash;based recruitment. Artificial intelligence tools help reduce recruitment costs, while learning management systems enhance the flexibility of professional development. It was found that digital transformation of HR functions directly affects labor productivity &mdash; in companies where automated KPI evaluation and monitoring systems were implemented, operational efficiency increased by 20&ndash;25%. A significant role in the success of the transformation is played by employee engagement in the change process &mdash; through gamification, social interaction platforms, and a transparent feedback system. It was concluded that the effectiveness of HR digitalization largely depends on the level of organizational culture, digital literacy of staff, and readiness for institutional changes. The obtained results have practical significance for the development of digital HR strategies in construction companies aiming to increase productivity and comply with sustainable development criteria.<br>Conclusions. The integration of digital technologies and innovations into HR management of construction companies is a strategically important factor in increasing labor productivity, adapting to the requirements of sustainable development, and strengthening market competitiveness. The study proved that the digitalization of HR functions contributes not only to the automation of routine processes but also to the formation of new formats of interaction, development of human capital, and enhancement of corporate responsibility. The developed model of digital&ndash;innovative HR management allows for the comprehensive transformation of internal organizational processes, ensuring decision&ndash;making efficiency, transparency of procedures, and increased employee engagement. At the same time, the success of this transformation depends on a holistic approach &mdash; the harmonization of digital tools with the company&rsquo;s culture, ethical norms of interaction, and strategic development goals. The implementation of modular platforms that combine performance analysis, recruitment, training, internal communication, and performance management on a unified basis becomes especially relevant. It is also important to consider the social aspects of digitalization &mdash; preventing digital inequality, developing employees&rsquo; digital competence, and ensuring information security. Thus, the integration of digital innovations into HR management in the construction sector should be aimed not only at increasing efficiency but also at creating a value&ndash;oriented environment in which the employee is an active agent of change, not a passive object of digital solutions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This dissertation seeks to examine the connection between business and artificial intelligence (AI) in the health sector, major possibilities, and the current ethical issues. It is evident that adoption of AI has revolutionized healthcare by improving clients&rsquo; satisfaction, productivity and cost by using technological tools such as analytical tools, tele surgery, and disease diagnosis. This is important because the global AI healthcare market has been estimated to grow to $45.2 Billion by 2026. The study of two different countries &ndash; the United States and the United Kingdom &ndash; offers an understanding of AI implementation, legislation, and ethical standards as the result of different health systems and legislation. This work reveal potential benefits are enhanced diagnostic accuracy, cost savings whereas the potential harms include violations of patient privacy, bias in algorithms, and accountable issues. The target field adopts theoretical concepts such as The Technology Acceptance Model and The Diffusion of Innovation Theory to review factors affecting AI uptake. This also looks into ethical considerations as a way of making sure that properly applied. The implications of the chosen regulatory frameworks as tools for the analysis of business and patient care strategies are demonstrated in the studied examples of GDPR and HIPAA. The studies provide practical recommendations for both healthcare organizations and policy-makers as well as companies that are importing AI into their services. In conclusion, this research provides to the improvement of healthcare while exploring the signals for confronting the moral issues of AI application on global healthcare settings</p>",

        "description": "<p>&nbsp;In Environmental Sciences, Time-series data is key to, for example, monitoring environmental processes and validating Earth system models. A major issue is the lack of a consistent data availability standard aligned with the FAIR principles, but the Helmholtz Earth and Environment DataHub is working with the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration project STAMPLATE to address this.</p>\n<p>The seven participating research centers are building a large-scale infrastructure using the Open Geospatial Consortium's SensorThings API (STA) as the central data interface. It is linked to other community-driven tools, such as sensor and device management systems, data ingestion systems, and the Earth Data Portal (www.earth-data.de) with highly customizable viewers.</p>\n<p>Our custom, semantic metadata profile augments STA&rsquo;s core data model with domain-specific information. This ensures that metadata entered in any user self-service is also displayed in the Earth Data Portal along with the ingested data.</p>\n<p>The operationalization of the framework and its subsequent integration into research data workflows is imminent, thereby rendering long-term, nationwide measurements spanning decades available. Concurrently, our RDM processes are undergoing a transformative shift, moving from manual, person-based to self-organized, digital-supported workflows.</p>\n<p>This poster presents the fundamental elements of our initiative and the associated challenges. It also encourages new domains to get involved.&nbsp;</p>",
