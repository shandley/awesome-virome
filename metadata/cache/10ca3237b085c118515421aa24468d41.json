Check it out is Molecular Ecology Resources -- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13978\n\n10/23/2023 -> vAMPirus manuscript is currently in revision in Molecular Ecology Resources and there are plans to update the framework within the next year. Please note to run the vAMPirus.nf script you will not be able to use the most recent version of Nextflow (v23). You can download version 22 and it will run perfectly fine still. As always, please let us know if you run into any issues.\n\n2/9/23 -> vAMPirus preprint has been released, check it out here: https://www.authorea.com/users/584435/articles/623635-vampirus-a-versatile-amplicon-processing-and-analysis-program-for-studying-viruses\n\n1/20/23 -> We have created the vAMPirus Analysis Repository community on Zenodo for everyone to upload their non-read files used for their vAMPirus analyses. This is an initiative to increase shareability and reproducibility of virus amplicon sequencing analyses. \n\n1/10/23 -> Updated code to produce the NMDS plot in the report, still not fully tested but changes should prevent errors from using deprecated code.\n\n12/16/22 -> We noticed there were some changes in the new version of vegan which we updated to in v2.1.0. We are working to fix the issue but the reports should be generated without error, if you experience an error, you can still find the files used to generate results within the results directories. You can also use --skipReport to skip the report generation all together.\n\n11/27/22 -> we have updated vAMPirus to v2.1.0\n\n# Table of contents\n* [New in vAMPirus version 2.1.0](#New-in-vAMPirus-version-2.1.0)\n* [Quick intro](#Quick-intro)\n  * [Contact/support](#Contact/support)\n* [Getting started](#Getting-started)\n  * [Order of operations](##Order-of-operations)\n    * [Dependencies](###Dependencies-(See-How-to-cite))\n* [Installing vAMPirus](#Installing-vAMPirus)\n  * [Setting up vAMPirus dependencies](#Setting-up-vAMPirus-dependencies)\n    * [Quick set up](#vAMPirus-startup-script)\n* [Testing vAMPirus install](#Testing-vAMPirus-installation)\n* [Running vAMPirus](#Running-vAMPirus)\n* [Who to cite](#Who-to-cite)\n\n# Introduction to vAMPirus\n\nViruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and with advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, there has been significant effort in deciphering the global virome and its impact in nature (Suttle 2007; Breitbart 2019). A common method for studying viruses in the lab or environment is amplicon sequencing, an economic and effective approach for investigating virus diversity and community dynamics. The highly targeted nature of amplicon sequencing allows in-depth characterization of genetic variants within a specific taxonomic grouping facilitating both virus discovery and screening within samples. Although, the high volume of amplicon data produced combined with the highly variable nature of virus evolution across different genes and virus-types can make it difficult to scale and standardize analytical approaches. Here we present vAMPirus (https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus.git), an automated and easy-to-use virus amplicon sequencing analysis program that is integrated with the Nextflow workflow manager facilitating easy scalability and standardization of analyses.\n\n# vAMPirus Analysis Repository -- Zenodo Community\n\n\"Reproducibility and research integrity are essential tenets of every scientific study and discovery. They serve as proof that an established and documented work can be verified, repeated, and reproduced..\" - Diaba-Nuhoho and Amponsah-Offeh 2021 (https://tinyurl.com/279recr3)\n\nTo  promote and simplify the sharing and reproduction of vAMPirus analyses we have created a Zenodo Community 'vAMPirus Analysis Repository' (zenodo.org/communities/vampirusrepo) that is meant to be a central location for all vAMPirus analyses described in a published report/preprint/manuscript. Here investigators will archive and share the non-read files in a compressed folder required to reproduce their virus amplicon analyses.\n\nFor the benefit of the field and science as a whole, we recommend uploading all non-read files needed to reproduce your analysis. For more information see the manual here: https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus/blob/master/docs/HelpDocumentation.md#vampirus-analysis-repository----zenodo-community\n\n# New in vAMPirus version 2.1.0\n\n1. Supports single-end read libraries as input.\n\n2. Changed to have process-specific Conda evironments and Singularity/Docker containers (should help with stability).\n\n3. Added output of R-based analyses performed during Report generation.\n\n4. Use of Alignment Ensemble approach from musclev5 for high confidence sequence alignments\n\n5. Added the use of Transfer Bootstrap Exptecation (TBE) in IQTREE analyses.\n\n# New in vAMPirus version 2.0.0 and up\n\n1. Reduced redundancy of processes and the volume of generated result files per full run (Example - read processing only done once if running DataCheck then Analyze).\n\n2. Added further taxonomic classification of sequences using the RVDB annotation database and/or NCBI taxonomy files (see manual for more info).\n\n3. Replaced the used of MAFFT with muscle v5 (Edgar 2021) for higher confidence virus gene alignments (see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.449169v1.full).\n\n4. Added multiple primer pair removal to deal with multiplexed amplicon libraries.\n\n5. ASV filtering - you can now provide a \"filter\" and \"keep\" database to remove certain sequences from the analysis\n\n6. (EXPERIMENTAL) Added Minimum Entropy Decomposition analysis using the oligotyping program produced by the Meren Lab. This allows for sequence clustering based on sequence positions of interest (biologically meaningful) or top positions with the highest Shannon's Entropy (read more here: https://merenlab.org/software/oligotyping/ ; and below).\n\n7. Phylogeny-based clustering ASV or AminoType sequences with TreeCluster (https://github.com/niemasd/TreeCluster; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221068)\n\n8. Color nodes on phylogenetic trees based on Taxonomy or Minimum Entropy Decomposition results or TreeClustering results.\n\n8. PCoA plots added to Analyze report if NMDS does not converge.\n\n# Quick intro\n\n![vAMPirus general workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aveglia/vAMPirusExamples/main/vAMPirus_generalflow.png)\n\n\nThe vAMPirus program contains two different pipelines:\n\n1. DataCheck pipeline: provides the user an interactive html report file containing information regarding sequencing success per sample as well as a preliminary look into the clustering behavior of the data which can be leveraged by the user to inform future analyses\n\n![vAMPirus DataCheck](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aveglia/vAMPirusExamples/main/vampirusflow_datacheckV3_11_21_22.png)\n\n2. Analyze pipeline: a comprehensive analysis of the provided data producing a wide range of results and outputs which includes an interactive report with figures and statistics. Red line represents path for nucleotide sequences, blue represents path for protein sequences.\n\n\n![vAMPirus Analyze](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aveglia/vAMPirusExamples/main/vampirusflow_analyzeV3_11_27_22.png)\n\n\nNOTE => This is a more brief overview of how to install and set up vAMPirus, for more detail see the [manual](https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus/blob/master/docs/HelpDocumentation.md).\n\n\n## Contact/support:\n\nIf you have a feature request or any feedback/questions, feel free to email vAMPirusHelp@gmail.com or you can open an Issue on GitHub.\n\n\n# Getting started\n\n## Quick order of operations\n\n1. Clone vAMPirus from github\n\n2. Before launching the vAMPirus.nf, be sure to run the vampirus_startup.sh script to install dependencies and/or databases (NOTE: You will need to have the xz program installed before running startup script when downloading the RVDB database)\n\n3. Test the vAMPirus installation with the provided test dataset (if you have ran the start up script, you can see EXAMPLE_COMMANDS.txt in the vAMPirus directory for test commands and other examples)\n\n4. Edit parameters in vampirus.config file\n\n5. Launch the DataCheck pipeline to get summary information about your dataset (e.g. sequencing success, read quality information, clustering behavior of ASV or AminoTypes)\n\n6. Change any parameters in vampirus.config file that might aid your analysis (e.g. clustering ID, maximum merged read length, Shannon entropy analysis results)\n\n7. Launch the Analyze pipeline to perform a comprehensive analysis with your dataset\n\n8. Explore results directories and produced final reports\n\n\n### Installing dependencies (see Who to cite section)\n\nNew in v3.0.0 the dependencies of vAMPirus will be set up by Nextflow upon the initial launch of a vAMPirus pipeline regardless if you plan to use Conda or Singularity/Docker.\n\nRun the start up script to set paths automatically in the configuration file, install Conda, and install any databases.\n\n\n# Installing vAMPirus\n\n## Windows OS users\n\nvAMPirus has been set up and tested on Windows 10 using Ubuntu Sandbox (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL) which is a feature of Windows 10 - See Windows Subsystem for Linux -> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about\n\nAll you will need to do is set up the subsystem with whatever flavor of Linux you favor and then you can follow the directions for installation and running as normal.\n\nSearch for Linux in the Microsoft store -> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search?q=linux\n\nFor more detail see the [manual](https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus/blob/master/docs/HelpDocumentation.md).\n\n## MacOS users\n\nIf you plan to run vAMPirus on a Mac computer, it is recommended that you set up a virtual environment and use Singularity with the vAMPirus Docker image to run your analyses.\n\nYou can try to run directly on your system, but there may be errors caused by differences between Apply and GNU versions of tools like \"sort\".\n\nFor more detail see the [manual](https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus/blob/master/docs/HelpDocumentation.md).\n\n\n## Cloning repository\n\nClone the most recent version of vAMPirus from GitHub using:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus.git\n\nOR you can download the most recent stable release vAMPirus v2.0.0 (Polymerase I) by using:\n\n    wget https://github.com/Aveglia/vAMPirus/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.tar.gz\n\n\n## Setting up vAMPirus dependencies\n\nvAMPirus is integrated with Nextflow (https://www.Nextflow.io) which relies on Java being installed on your system.\n\nIf you know you do not have it installed, see here for instructions on installing Java for different operating software's -> https://opensource.com/article/19/11/install-java-linux ; for Debian https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-java-ubuntu\n\nIf you are unsure, you can check using:\n\n\n    which java\n\n\nor\n\n\n    java -version\n\n\nThe output from either of those commands should let you know if you have Java on your system.\n\nYou will also need to decide if you plan to use a container engine like Docker (https://www.docker.com/) or Singularity (https://singularity.lbl.gov/) or the package manager Conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\nThe startup script provided in the vAMPirus program directory will install Conda for you if you tell it to (see below), however, unless you plan to run in the Vagrant VM as described above, you will need to install Docker or Singularity before running vAMPirus.\n\n\n### vAMPirus startup script\nTo set up and install vAMPirus dependencies (e.g., Conda, Nextflow), simply move to the vAMPirus directory and run the vampirus_startup.sh script.\n\n    cd ./vAMPirus; bash vampirus_startup.sh -h\n\n\n>You can make the vampirus_startup.sh scrip an exectuable with -> chmod +x vampirus_startup.sh ; ./vampirus_startup.sh\n\n\nThe start up script will check your system for Nextflow and Anaconda/Miniconda (can be skipped) and if they are not present, the script will ask if you would like to install these programs. If you answer with 'y', the script will install the missing programs and the installation is complete.\n\nYou can also use the startup script to install different databases to use for vAMPirus analyses, these include:\n\n1. NCBIs Viral protein RefSeq database\n2. The proteic version of the Reference Viral DataBase (RVDB) (See https://f1000research.com/articles/8-530)\n3. The complete NCBI NR protein database\n\nTo use the vampirus_startup.sh script to download any or all of these databases listed above you just need to use the \"-d\" option and you can download the NCBI taxonomy files with the option \"-t\" (See below).\n\nIf we take a look at the vampirus_startup.sh script usage:\n\nGeneral execution:\n\nvampirus_startup.sh -h [-d 1|2|3|4] [-s] [-t]\n\n    Command line options:\n\n        [ -h ]                       \tPrint help information\n\n        [ -d 1|2|3|4 ]                Set this option to create a database directiory within the current working directory and download the following databases for taxonomy assignment:\n\n                                                    1 - Download only the proteic version of the Reference Viral DataBase (See the paper for more information on this database: https://f1000research.com/articles/8-530)\n                                                    2 - Download only NCBIs Viral protein RefSeq database\n                                                    3 - Download only the complete NCBI NR protein database\n                                                    4 - Download all three databases\n\n        [ -s ]                       Set this option to skip conda installation and environment set up (you can use if you plan to run with Singularity and the vAMPirus Docker container)\n\n        [ -t ]                       Set this option to download NCBI taxonomy files needed for DIAMOND to assign taxonomic classification to sequences (works with NCBI type databases only, see manual for more information)\n\n\nFor example, if you would like to install Nextflow, download NCBIs Viral Protein RefSeq database, the NCBI taxonomy files to use DIAMOND taxonomy assignment feature, and check/install conda, run:\n\n    bash vampirus_startup.sh -d 2 -t\n\nand if we wanted to do the same thing as above but skip the Conda check/installation, run:\n\n    bash vampirus_startup.sh -d 2 -s\n\nNOTE -> if you end up installing Miniconda3 using the script you might have to close and re-open the terminal window after everything is completed.\n\n**NEW in version 2.0.0 -> the startup script will automatically download annotation information from RVDB to infer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) information for hits during taxonomy assignment. You can also use \"-t\" to download NCBI taxonomy files to infer taxonomy using the DIAMOND taxonomy classification feature.\n\n\n# Testing vAMPirus installation\n\nThe startup script will generate a text file (STARTUP_HELP.txt) that has instructions and example commands to test the installation.\n\nNOTE => If using Singularity, when you run the test command calling for singularity (-profile singularity) Nextflow will set up the dependencies.\n\nLaunch commands for testing (you do not need to edit anything in the config files for test commands):\n\n### DataCheck test =>\n\n      `/path/to/nextflow run /path/to/vAMPirus.nf -c /path/to/vampirus.config -profile conda,test --DataCheck -resume`\n\nOR\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile singularity,test --DataCheck -resume`\n\n### Analyze test =>\n\n      `/path/to/nextflow run /path/to/vAMPirus.nf -c /path/to/vampirus.config -profile conda,test --Analyze -resume`\n\nOR\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile singularity,test --Analyze -resume`\n\n\n# Running vAMPirus\n\nIf you done the setup and confirmed installation success with the test commands, you are good to get going with your own data. Before getting started edit the configuration file with the parameters and other options you plan to use.\n\nHere are some example vAMPirus launch commands:\n\n### DataCheck pipeline =>\n\nExample 1. Launching the vAMPirus DataCheck pipeline using conda and Shannon Entropy Analysis on ASVs and AminoTypes\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile conda --DataCheck --asvMED --aminoMED`\n\nExample 2. Launching the vAMPirus DataCheck pipeline using Singularity and multiple primer removal with the path to the fasta file with the primer sequences set in the launch command\n\n      nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile singularity --DataCheck --multi --primers /PATH/TO/PRIMERs.fa\n\nExample 3. Launching the vAMPirus DataCheck pipeline with primer removal by global trimming of 20 bp from forward reads and 26 bp from reverse reads\n\n      nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile conda --DataCheck --GlobTrim 20,26\n\n### Analyze pipeline =>\n\nExample 4. Launching the vAMPirus Analyze pipeline with singularity with ASV and AminoType generation with all accesory analyses (taxonomy assignment, EMBOSS, IQTREE, statistics)\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile singularity --Analyze --stats`\n\nExample 5. Launching the vAMPirus Analyze pipeline with conda to perform multiple primer removal and protein-based clustering of ASVs, but skip most of the extra analyses\n\n      nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile conda --Analyze --pcASV --skipPhylogeny --skipEMBOSS --skipTaxonomy --skipReport\n\nExample 6. Launching vAMPirus Analyze pipeline with conda to produce only ASV and AminoType-based results with Shannon Entropy Analyses with the nodes on produced phylogenies colored based on taxnomy hit\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile conda --Analyze --asvMED --aminoMED --nodeCol TAX --stats`\n\n## Resuming analyses =>\n\nIf an analysis is interrupted, you can use Nextflows \"-resume\" option that will start from the last cached \"check point\".\n\nFor example if the analysis launched with the command from Example 6 above was interrupted, all you would need to do is add the \"-resume\" to the end of the command like so:\n\n      `nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c vampirus.config -profile conda --Analyze --asvMED --aminoMED --nodeCol TAX --stats -resume`\n\n# Who to cite:\n\nIf you do use vAMPirus for your analyses, please cite the following ->\n\n1. vAMPirus - Veglia, A.
