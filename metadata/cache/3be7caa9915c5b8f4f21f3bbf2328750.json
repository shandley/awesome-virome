The GOV2 collection was partitioned into host-name subcollections and distributed to multiple remote machines. The Multisearch demonstration application restricted each search to a fraction of the available sub-collections that was pre-determined by a resource-selection algorithm. Experiment results from topic-by-topic resource selection and aggregate topic resource selection are compared. The sensitivity of Multisearch retrieval performance to variations in the resource selection algorithm is discussed.",

The GOV2 collection was partitioned by hostname and the aggregate performance of each host, as measured by qrel counts from the past TREC Terabyte Tracks, was used to rank the hosts in order of quality. Only the 100 highest quality hosts were included in the Grid IR simulation, representing less than 20% of all GOV2 documents. The IR performance of the GIR simulation, as measured by the topic-averaged AP, b-pref, and Rel@10 over the TREC Terabyte-Track topics is within one standard deviation of the respective topic-averaged TREC Million Query participant median scores. Estimated AP of the Million Query topic results is comparable to the topic-averaged AP of the Terabyte topic results.",

Methods: One-hundred-and-seventeen GOV2 patients from June 2018 to June 2020 were divided into the observation group ([Formula: see text]) and control group ([Formula: see text]). The observation group was treated with endoscopic titanium clip combined with the tissue adhesive, while controls were treated with tissue adhesive alone. The clinical effects were compared at 1, 6, and 24 months. Results: Overall response rates of the observation group at 1, 6, and 24 months were 98.31%, 96.61%, and 91.53%, respectively, vs. 81.03%, 76.27%, and 55.17% in controls ([Formula: see text]). The number, diameters, red color sign proportion of varicose veins, and incidence of bleeding in the observation group were lower than the control group, and the GQOL-74 (Generic Quality of Life Inventory 74) score was higher at 1, 6, and 24 months ([Formula: see text]). There was no significant difference in complications, mortality at 6 and 24 months, and recurrence rate at 6 months ([Formula: see text]); however, the recurrence rate at 24 months after treatment was lower in the observation group (6.78% vs. 20.69%) ([Formula: see text]). Conclusions: Endoscopic titanium clips combined with tissue adhesive can be applied to treat GOV2 patients. </jats:p>",

      "description": "Our experiments focused this year on the ad-hock task of the Terabyte track. We experimented with WAND, a document-at-a-time evaluation algorithm we developed recently. Our results demonstrate the superiority of WAND over traditional term-a-time strategy while searching over a large collection such as gov2. We demonstrate how Web expansion can be successfully applied to significantly improve search results. In addition, we describe several schemes for creating manual queries, following this year's goal to enrich the pool of results by manual runs.",

Overall effectiveness of our combined model and the relative contribution from each component is evaluated on the GOV2 webpage collection. Given 0-5 feedback documents, we find each component contributes unique value to the overall ensemble, achieving significant improvement individually and in combination. Comparative evaluation in the 2008 TREC Relevance Feedback track further shows our complete system typically performs as well or better than peer systems.",

      "description": "Aslam, Pavlu, and Savell [3] introduced the Hedge algorithm for metasearch which effectively combines the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple retrieval systems in response to a given query. It has been demonstrated that the Hedge algorithm is an effective technique for metasearch, often significantly exceeding the performance of standard metasearch and IR techniques over small TREC collections. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of Hedge as an automatic metasearch engine over the much larger GOV2 collection on about 1700 topics as part of the Million Query Track of TREC 2007.",

We focused on partitioning the data in the GOV2 collection across a homogeneous cluster of machines and indexing and querying the collection in a distributed fashion using different standard retrieval models on a single system, such as the Robertson BM25 probabilistic measure and a vector space measure. Our partitioned indices were each independent of each other, with independent collection statistics and lexicons. We combined the results as if all indices were the same, however, not weighing any one result set more or less than another",

      "description": "York University participated in the terabyte track this year. Using the GOV2 collection, we used filtering techniques to shorten the amount of data to be indexed before indexing into eight partitions. As there were several different subsections of the terabyte track, we chose to participate in the ad hoc and named page retrieval runs. Our technique involved partitioned indexes across a single machine. We combined our results by first calculating the document frequency of a term across all the indexes, calculating the weight, then using the same weight in retrieving the top results from each index. This approach effectively tried to mimic the results that would be obtained if there were only one large index.",
