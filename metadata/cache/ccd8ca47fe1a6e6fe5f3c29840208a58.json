    "abstract": ": Network monitoring is receiving more attention than ever with the need for a self-driving network to tackle increasingly severe network management challenges. Advanced management applications rely on traf\ufb01c data analyses, which require network monitoring to \ufb02exibly provide comprehensive traf\ufb01c characteristics. Moreover, in virtualized environments, software network monitoring is constrained by available resources and requirements of cloud operators. In this paper, Trident, a policy-based network monitoring system at the host, is proposed. Trident is a novel monitoring approach, off-path con\ufb01gurable streaming, which offers remote analyzers a \ufb01ne-grained holistic view of the network traf\ufb01c. A novel fast path packet classi\ufb01cation algorithm and a corresponding cached \ufb02ow form are also proposed to improve monitoring ef\ufb01ciency. Evaluated in a practical deployment, Trident demonstrates negligible interference with forwarding and requires no additional software dependencies. Trident has been deployed in production networks of several Tier-IV datacenters.",
