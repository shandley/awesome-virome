Length of forewing 5.1&ndash;5.3 mm. Length of hind tibia 1.6&ndash;1.7 mm. Marginal cell of forewing 3.2&ndash; 3.6 mm.</p><p><i>Remarks</i>. In the present study, we recorded <i>A</i>. <i>mukaigawae</i> for the first time in Myanmar. Abe <i>et al.</i> (2012) recorded <i>A</i>. <i>mukaigawae</i> in northeastern India and regarded it as the first record of a gall wasp with a distribution from East Asia to the Indian subcontinent. Our finding of <i>A</i>. <i>mukaigawae</i> in Myanmar supports and expands on this contention. In both instances, <i>A</i>. <i>mukaigawae</i> was recorded from <i>Q</i>. <i>griffithii</i>, which is widely distributed in the Oriental region, including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam (Govaerts &amp; Frodin 1998). This suggests that <i>A</i>. <i>mukaigawae</i> may have a wide distribution across East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Indochinese Peninsula. Myanmar lies at the northwestern edge of the Indochinese Peninsula, most of which is in the Oriental region, but northern Myanmar is adjacent to the Palearctic region (Udvardy, 1975; Morrone, 2015). Therefore, Myanmar is important in terms of the biogeographic connection between the Oriental and Palearctic regions inhabited by Asian Cynipidae.</p><p><i>Lithosaphonecrus mindatus</i>, the only known cynipid species in Myanmar before this study, belongs to the tribe Synergini. <i>Andricus mukaigawae</i> belongs to the tribe Cynipini, which is known for inducing galls on oaks and their relatives, and is thus known as the oak gall wasp. Therefore, this is the first record of the oak gall wasp and the second record of the family Cynipidae in Myanmar. Both Cynipini and Synergini consist of herbivorous insects associated with oaks and their relatives of the family Fagaceae (Ronquist <i>et al.</i>, 2015; Buffington <i>et al.</i>, 2020), and host plant diversity is important when estimating the species richness of herbivorous insects (Lin <i>et al.</i>, 2015). As approximately 80% of all known cynipid species belong to the two tribes (Ronquist <i>et al.</i>, 2015), the diversity of Fagaceae is important for cynipid diversity. Two species of <i>Castanea</i>, 15 of <i>Castanopsis</i>, 31 of <i>Lithocarpus</i>, and 33 of <i>Quercus</i>, which belong to Fagaceae, have been recorded in Myanmar (Kress <i>et al.</i>, 2003). In particular, the mountainous areas of the northern to northwestern ranges of Myanmar (Kachin, Sagaing, and Chin) are species-rich in oaks and their relatives; at least one species of <i>Castanea</i>, seven of <i>Castanopsis</i>, 17 of <i>Lithocarpus</i>, and 21 of <i>Quercus</i> have been recorded (Kress <i>et al.</i>, 2003). This suggests that further field surveys focusing on these areas will help uncover the species diversity of the Cynipidae in Myanmar.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The hispid hare, <span><em>Caprolagus</em> <em>hispidus</em></span>, is an endangered elusive mammal that dwells in the tall grassland of the Himalayan foothills across Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The species has faced serious threats from anthropogenic activity and seasonal flooding in the various protected areas, leading to population decline. Most work on the species has been conducted in the grasslands of Shuklaphanta National Park, but only one study has been conducted in Bardia National Park over the past decade. Here, we aim to evaluate current distribution pattern of the hispid hare in the Babai Valley of Bardia National Park, identify the environmental factors that influenced distribution, and assess existing threats to the species. <span>We conducted a field survey in December 2020 before grassland burn and May-June 2021, after a grassland burn. A total of 428 transects (50 m * 2 m) in a 1 km x 1 km grid were conducted across 1048.55 hectares of grassland in the valley. Hispid hare pellets were recorded in the grassland of Kalinara, Guthi, Sano Shree Phanta, Chitaale Phanta, Ratomate, Rhino Release Site (Babai), and Mulghat (Chepang) in Bardia National Park. The distribution pattern of the pellets was found to be clumped in the Babai Valley. We recorded higher pellet density post-grassland burn than the pre-burn, which indicated higher population density in summer in comparison to winter. The best-fit model suggested that </span>grass density, grassland burning, and annual precipitation have influenced the distribution of hispid hare. <span>Results suggest the species prefers the riverbank in winter but short grassland in summer, while the forest and edge between the grassland and forest were avoided. The grassland patches in Babai (preferred hispid hare habitat) comprised 14 grass species in Babai dominated by <em>Imperata</em> <em>cylindrica</em>, <em>Schharum</em> <em>spontaneum</em>, and <em>Cynodon</em> <em>doctylon</em>. Seasonal grassland burn, summer flood, invasive species, vegetation succession, and predators were major threats in the field. Our findings can help park officials in the management and restoration of degraded grassland of the park and guide the developing management and species action plan. We recommend conservation efforts focus on protecting and managing grasslands that provide suitable habitat for the hispid hare.</span></p>",

Originally it was widely distributed in the grasslands of the Indo-Gangetic plain and the lowlands bordering the southern Himalaya, from Pakistan to southern Nepal, Assam, and Sundarbans to central India. In the early 20&quot; century it was exterminated in the Sundarbans and during the 1930s-1960s suffered a dramatic reduction of its range due to conversion of vast areas to agriculture. There are now a total of 3500-5100 individuals in small isolated populations in northern and central India and south-western Nepal. It is extinct in Pakistan. The northern subspecies duvaucelii is the most numerous. In Nepalit persists only in two localities, Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (with 1700 animals) and Royal Karnali-Bardiya Wildlife Reserve (with 50-100 individuals). In Assam the population of Kaziranga National Park grew from 200-250 deer in 1966 to 750 in 1984, then declined to 400-500 in 2004. In central India the subspecies branderi which survives only in the Kanha National Park increased from 50-65 animals in 1966 to 300-350 in 2004. Habitat degradation, competition with livestock, and poaching are major current threats outside well-secured protected areas.. <b>Bibliography.</b> Groves (1982), Martin (1977), Moe (1994), Qureshi et al.

Few data exist on body mass of wild individuals. Males born in zoos are often more than 25 cm taller at the shoulder and considerably larger in mass than females. Like other perissodactyls, wild adult males and females show near monomorphism. Reduced size dimorphism in free-ranging animals may be explained by greater stress on males, and poor nutrition during the long non-breeding interval, when young adults are harassed by dominant males and excluded from prime grazing areas. Adult males develop longer mandibular incisors (tusks) and greater neck musculature than females. The lower outer incisors are 4-5 cm long, more than 3 cm at the base (females) and longer in males (if entire, 5:1.8-9 cm) or often broken. Long incisors (rather than horns), powerful neck and shoulder muscles, and extensive neck and shoulder skin folds figure prominently in fights and displays between breedingage males. The incisors are formidable offensive and defensive weapons, and are used rather than the horn in combat. Horn length averages 25 cm in adult males and 24 cm in adult females, but females often have longer (though slightly narrower) horns than the males that breed with them. Horn wear in adult males is common. This species has two distinct skin folds that drape over the sides of the front and hindlegs. Deep scars on anal folds, extra skin folds known as epidermal knobs, cuts on the ears, and missing tail tips allow for easy recognition of adults. Hair is limited to fringes ofears, eyelashes, and tail tip. Body color is gray and a mosaic-like pattern on the skin is quite noticeable on rump. Pedal scent glands are present.</p><p><b>Habitat.</b> Greater One-horned Rhinos flourish in what are arguably the world&rsquo;s tallest grasslands, in protected areas along the main river systems in the lowlands of the Himalayas. The rhinos generally avoid upland Shorea robusta forest, a dominant forest type, except during monsoon inundations, when these forests serve as temporary refugia. Oxbow lakes and other water features are important for wallowing and feeding on aquatic plants; this species is rarely found more than 2 km from water.</p><p><b>Food and Feeding.</b> Greater One-horned Rhinos are primarily grazers, with the grass Saccharum spontaneum comprising a major part of the diet in all months of the year. During the winter months, rhinos browse much more frequently, as determined by fecal analysis and direct observation. In winter, scrub vegetation that is often found along the buffer zones on the edge of parks holds a particular attraction for the animals. They feed heavily on several browse species prevalent there, including Callicarpa macrophylla and Cassia tora. Even the stick-tight fruits and stems of the weedy Xanthium stromarium, an introduced weed normally dispersed on animal fur, are sought out by the rhino. Croplands attract rhinos and all of the other ungulates, and require nightly vigilance by farmers to scare animals away. Rhinos are partial to rice, corn, and wheat at ripening. They seek out and devour hot chilli plants, but feed only sparingly on the mustard crop. Most of their damage to crops occurs within a kilometer from park boundaries. Greater One-horned Rhinos ingested the fruits of at least 23 species of herbaceous and woody plants. Seeds manured into grassland latrines used by the rhinos yielded distinct assemblages of dicotyledonous plants. Trewia nudiflora, the most common riverine forest tree in Chitwan, and C. tora, an herb, accounted for most of the herbaceous cover. Although unattractive to arboreal and volant frugivores (monkeys, bats, and birds), Trewia fruit is an important food source for the rhino during the monsoon. The rhino plays an important role in dispersal and recruitment of woody species in riverine grasslands. Greater One-horned Rhinos have other profound effects on their landscape&mdash;they exert strong selective pressure on forest structure and canopy composition by inhibiting vertical growth of saplings, by frequent browsing and trampling.</p><p><b>Breeding.</b> Males form dominance hierarchies. An alpha male&rsquo;s tenure is short in comparison with his life span. The long mean interbirth interval (46 months), long gestation (16 months), and the presence of a small number of breeding age females in a population indicate that breeding opportunities are probably few for individual males. Limited chances for copulation probably heighten aggressive behavior when a female cycles into estrus. Non-breeding males seldom use prime grazing areas dominated by the grass S. spontaneum and occupied by dominant males. Dominant males attack young adult males if they remain in areas where breeding females concentrate. In contrast, females may occupy such areas even as subadults, and continue to occupy the maternal home range as adults. During fights to determine dominance, the males slash and gouge one another with the razor-sharp lower outer incisors, rather than relying on the horn. Three dominant males in Royal Chitwan National Park maintained their status with broken horns but intact incisors. No distinct season of parturition was detected based on births of 53 calves born during an intensive study conducted between 1984 and 1988 in which all breeding age females were photographed and monitored. Age at first reproduction for two known-age females was between 7-0 and 7-5 years. Interbirth intervals based on 13 females whose calves survived to independence were 45-6 + 1-8 months (range 34-51 months) Predation by Tigers (Panthera tigris) accounted for about 10% of calf mortality in one study where the two species overlapped. All calves killed by tigers were less than eight months old.</p><p><b>Activity patterns.</b> It is a challenge for very large herbivores in subtropical or tropical habitats to find enough to eat and to stay cool during hot weather. Rhinos forage 47-54% of the 24hour cycle with distinct differences observed between sexes. Females are often pregnant or nursing. Adult males devote time to defending or patrolling areas where females congregate, so spend less time foraging. Rhinos feed both day and night. This species spends less time feeding than the other grazing rhino, the White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), perhaps because the grasses that account for the bulk ofits diet are much more abundant. Rhinos graze extensively during the day in the hottest, driest month of the year (April) and use wallows infrequently, counter to what might be predicted based on thermoregulatory behavior of other megaherbivores. Conversely, during hot, humid periods (monsoons), the rhinos spend much of the day in wallows, presumably to avoid heat stress. Several factors probably contribute to increased heat stress during the monsoon. The days are longer then, and thus total solar radiation is greater. Wind speed is also reduced, so that heat loss through evaporative cooling is less. Most importantly, the high humidity reduces the ability of large-bodied herbivores to use evaporative cooling to deal with heat stress. Wallowing behavior, which peaks in the monsoon, is correlated with changes in vapor pressure density, a measure of the ability of air to hold water vapor at different temperatures. Thus, the problem of heat stress, combined with easy access to preferred forage, probably restrict Greater One-horned Rhinos to riverine habitats during the monsoon.</p><p><b>Movements, Home range and Social organization.</b> In prime habitat, adult females rarely travel more than 5 km during a 24hour period in any season. Adult breeding males travelled slightly longer distances during a 24hour period. Their movements were sufficient to allow them to cover most of their core areas of occupancy in a few days. Rarely does this species venture farther than 2 km from the river&rsquo;s edge or another source of water. Translocated animals wandered over long distances (sometimes more than 25 km) before establishing a permanent home range. Home range data for radiocollared individuals revealed that Greater One-horned Rhinos may have the smallest annual and seasonal home ranges of any large herbivore. Annual home ranges of breeding females averaged 3-5 km?*; males&rsquo; ranges were only only 4-3 km&reg;. The smallest home ranges were recorded for females during the monsoon, two females occupying core areas of only 22 ha and 28 ha, respectively. Females congregate in areas of excellent grass forage close to river banks. Males are notstrictly territorial, but form dominance hierarchies and attempt to defend areas where females congregate. Subadult males sometimes group together on the fringes of the best grazing areas. Adult males frequently fight, often resulting in serious injury and sometimes death.</p><p><b>Status and Conservation.</b> CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The Greater One-horned Rhino was once to be found right across the northern part of the Indian subcontinent,its range taking in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra river basins, and extending from Pakistan to the Indo-Burmese border, including parts of Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. It is also possible that it existed in Myanmar, southern China and Indochina, though this is unconfirmed. Common in north-western India and Pakistan up to about 1600, the species vanished from the region not long after that date. From 1600 to 1900 it suffered a sharp decline in numbers in the rest of its range, coming close to extinction at the start of the 20&quot; century. The number of populations (13) and the total global population of this species (now approaching 2700 individuals) have climbed steadily over the past two decades. Intensive translocation efforts since 1984 and natural dispersal have expanded the western populations from the single source population, Chitwan, in Nepal, to two other reserves in western Nepal and three in India. Translocations from some of the smaller reserves in Assam and Bengal are also underway. Despite these accomplishments, only two populations currently contain more than 100 individuals, Kaziranga, with about 2000 rhinos, and Chitwan, with about 420. In some parts of the range, poaching has been intense. All of the 85 animals translocated to the Babai Valley in Bardia National Park were poached during the ten-year Maoist insurgency that ended in 2008. A small population remains in another part of Bardia and Sukla Phanta. Nevertheless, this species is much better off than the other two Asian species. Its recovery is still in question because populations occupy what could become prime agricultural habitat (floodplains), and the species still faces intense poaching pressure for its body parts. Nevertheless, the increases in Chitwan and Kaziranga and the establishment of new populations provide some of the best evidence that large, slow-breeding mammals can still undergo rapid expansion. This offers hope for the restoration of other endangered large mammals if they enjoy similar efforts at protection.</p><p><b>Bibliography.</b> Amin et al.

        "description": "<p>Kalpana is Ayurveda terminology used for various types of drug preparation, this term is also used for types of food preparation as Ahara Kalpana. Ashtanga Hrudaya also explains the term Kalpana in Uttarasthana. The processing of medicinal substances is called Bheshaja kalpa while Ahara kalpa indicates the processing of food and management of the body is called Kaya kalpa. The Ayurveda drugs are prepared from various sources including materials obtained from plants, metals, minerals, and marine and animal products. (1-5) The consideration of the concept of Kalpana helps to achieve the best possible drug formulation in terms of efficacy, safety, and palatability. The processing of plant materials as five basic methods is called Panchvidh kashaya kalpana which includes Swrasa, Kalka, Kwatha, Phanta, and Hima. Sneha Kalpana is defined as the pharmaceutical process where the fat soluble and water soluble active principles are extracted from the basic ingredients into the Sneha. It is a procedure to prepare oleaginous medicine from substances like Kalka and Dravya. They are prepared in specific proportions by subjecting them to uniform heating patterns and duration to fulfill certain pharmaceutical parameters as per the requirement of therapeutics. Most of the Ayurvedic treatments and therapeutics are aimed at maintaining Jatharagni which is responsible for the maintenance of health and Sneha is considered the best one to stimulate Jatharagni. 5 This process or method ensures absorption of active therapeutic principles of the ingredients in two different solvents i.e. water and fat and also some chemical constituents which are soluble in other different Medias like Kanji, Gomutra, etc.</p>",
