This needs to be done only the first time you run ViromeQC. This may require a few minutes, depending on your internet connection.\n\n`viromeQC.py --install`\n\nAlternatively, you can also download the database files from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4020594#.X1jxgGMzZDM). Once downloaded the files, create a folder named `index/` in the ViromeQC installation folder and unzip all the files in this folder.\n\n### Step 3: Run on your sample ###\n\n`viromeQC.py -i <input_virome_file(s)> -o <report_file.txt>`\n\n*Please Note:* \nYou can pass more than one file as input (e.g. for multiple runs or paired end reads). However, you can process only one sample at a time with this command. If you want to parallelize the execution, this can be easily done with [Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) or equivalent tools.\n\nYou can try the test example (`test/test.sh`) which analyzes 10'000 reads from the sample `SRR829034`. This should take approximately 1 or 2 minutes.\n\nParameters:\n\n```\nusage: viromeQC.py -i <input_virome_file> -o <report_file.txt>\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -i [INPUT [INPUT ...]], --input [INPUT [INPUT ...]]\n                        Raw Reads in FASTQ format.

Defualt: human-microbiome\n                        (default: human)\n  --bowtie2_path BOWTIE2_PATH\n                        Full path to the bowtie2 command to use, deafult\n                        assumes that bowtie2 is present in the system path\n                        (default: bowtie2)\n  --diamond_path DIAMOND_PATH\n                        Full path to the diamond command to use, deafult\n                        assumes that diamond is present in the system path\n                        (default: diamond)\n  --version             Prints version informations (default: False)\n  --install             Downloads database files (default: False)\n  --sample_name SAMPLE_NAME\n                        Optional label for the sample to be included in the\n                        output file (default: None)\n  --tempdir TEMPDIR     Temporary Directory override (default is the system\n                        temp. directory) (default: None)\n```\n\n### Pipeline structure ###\n\nViromeQC starts from FASTQ files (compressed files are supported), and will:\n\n1. Elimitate short and low quality reads\n    - *adjust the `minqual` and `minlen` parameters if you want to change the thresholds*\n2. Map the reads against a curated collection of rRNAs and single-copy bacteral markers\n3. Filter the reads to remove short and dlsivergent alignments\n4. Compute the enrichment value of the sample, compared to the median observed in human metagenomes\n    - use `-w environmental` for envronmental reads\n    - reference medians for un-enriched metagenomes are taken from `medians.csv`, you can provide your own data to ViromeQC by changing this file accordingly\n5. Produce a report file with the alignment rates and the final enrichment score (which is the minimum enrichment observed across SSU-rRNA, LSU-rRNA and single-copy markers)\n\n\n### Output ###\n\nOutput is given as a TSV file with the following structure:\n\n\n|    Sample    |    Reads    |    Reads_HQ    |    SSU rRNA alignment (%)    |    LSU rRNA alignment (%)   |    Bacterial_Markers alignment (%)   |    total enrichmnet score\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|    your_sample.fq | 40000 | 39479 | 0.00759898  | 0.0227969 | 0.01266496  | 5.795329\n\n\n- An alignment score of 5.8 means that the virome is 5.8 times more enriched than a comparable metagenome\n- High score (e.g. 10-50) reflect high VLP enrichment \n\n\n## Citation ##\n\nIf you find this tool useful, please cite:\n\n*Zolfo, M., Pinto, F., Asnicar, F., Manghi, P., Tett A., Segata N.* **[Detecting contamination in viromes using ViromeQC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0334-5)**, *Nature Biotechnology* 37, 1408\u20131412 (2019)\n\n"
