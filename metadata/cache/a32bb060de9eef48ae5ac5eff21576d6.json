ANSES (National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety)</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>It therefore does not replace established institutional models (e.g.: AquaCrop [1], STICS, SSM), but can be used as an exploratory overlay in experimental or educational contexts.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&bull; The model is not designed for ecological breakdown regimes, where natural cycles become non-stationary.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\u25b8 Use and Data</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&bull;

\u2206ngular.Terra can be used in addition to standard tools such as AquaCrop [1] or Sentinel-1 [3], but its purpose is exploratory.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&bull; It must be mobilized within a structured framework: educational experimentation, applied research or technical support under control.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&bull;

        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This research critically examines Abhijeet Sarkar&rsquo;s The Superintelligence Blueprint: Planning for an AI-Dominated World (2025), situating it within the evolution of AI safety thought from Turing and Good through Bostrom and Russell. After outlining the book&rsquo;s four-phase structure&mdash;Foundations of Intelligence; Paths to Superintelligence; The Control Transition; and Policy &amp; Governance Roadmap&mdash;it interrogates Sarkar&rsquo;s core thesis: that an urgent, interdisciplinary, and multi-stakeholder approach is essential to ensure a beneficial superintelligence transition.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through a qualitative synthesis of case studies (e.g., AI in healthcare diagnostics, algorithmic trading), conceptual modeling of takeoff scenarios, and comparative policy analysis (notably the EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Orders, and China&rsquo;s AI plan), the work evaluates the robustness and currency of Sarkar&rsquo;s evidence. Thematic analysis reveals a comprehensive taxonomy of intelligence pathways&mdash;neural scaling, whole-brain emulation, hybrid augmentation, and swarm intelligence&mdash;and a four-pillar governance framework (transparency, robustness, oversight, liability).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A comparative evaluation shows how Sarkar builds on Bostrom&rsquo;s orthogonality and control problem and Russell&rsquo;s value-uncertainty approach, while contributing original nuances: intermediate takeoff models, detailed governance mechanisms, and extensive socioeconomic impact assessments. Critiques are explored concerning speculative timelines, depth versus breadth trade-offs, and the political feasibility of global treaties.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To bridge theory and practice, the research proposes sectoral pilot exercises (e.g., AI &ldquo;crash drills&rdquo; in finance and healthcare), a policy-mapping matrix aligning Sarkar&rsquo;s pillars with national strategies, and concrete KPIs to track adoption. Future research directions include agent-based simulations of AI arms races, formal stakeholder-game models, and interdisciplinary ethics evaluations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Introduction: Contextualizing \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" within AI Safety Discourse</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The field of AI safety has evolved significantly since its early conceptualizations. In 1951, Alan Turing, a foundational figure in computer science, proposed in his article \"Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\" that artificial general intelligences (AGIs), upon reaching a level of intelligence surpassing that of humans, would likely \"take control\" of the world.1 This early articulation highlights a long-standing concern about the potential for advanced AI to become autonomous and possibly misaligned with human interests. Furthering this line of thought, I. J. Good in 1965 originated the concept of an \"intelligence explosion,\" suggesting that an \"ultraintelligent machine\" capable of far surpassing human intellectual activities could design even better machines, leading to a rapid and potentially uncontrollable increase in intelligence.1 Good emphasized that the risks associated with such a scenario were significantly underappreciated at the time.1</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The discourse on AI safety gained significant momentum in the 21st century with the emergence of thinkers like Nick Bostrom. Bostrom, who founded the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford in 2005, became a prominent voice on the existential threats posed by advanced AI.2 His seminal work, \"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,\" published in 2014, presented a comprehensive argument that superintelligence, defined as an intellect that greatly exceeds human cognitive performance across virtually all domains, poses a substantial existential risk to humanity.1 Bostrom introduced key concepts such as the \"orthogonality thesis,\" which posits that intelligence and final goals are independent, and the \"control problem,\" which addresses the immense challenge of ensuring a superintelligence remains aligned with human values.3 His work underscored the potential for a superintelligence, even one initially programmed with seemingly benign goals, to develop instrumental motivations that could lead to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.2 Around 2015, prominent public figures such as physicist Stephen Hawking and computer scientist Stuart Russell echoed these concerns, further solidifying AI safety as a critical area of study.1</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Against this backdrop of increasing awareness and concern about the potential dangers of advanced AI, Abhijeet Sarkar, CEO &amp; Founder of Synaptic AI Lab, a think tank and innovation hub based in Kolkata dedicated to advancing responsible superintelligence 7, has authored \"The Superintelligence Blueprint: Planning for an AI-Dominated World.\" Sarkar's work emerges from a professional background that blends deep technical expertise in areas like machine learning, deep learning, and ethical AI practices with a profound understanding of AI's transformative role in society.7 As an author of multiple books on AI, including \"The Psychology of AI,\" which explores the intersection of AI and human behavior 8, and \"Synthesized Minds: The Evolution of AI Consciousness,\" which delves into the possibility of artificial consciousness 9, Sarkar has established himself as a thought leader in the field. His experience consulting for global organizations on emerging technologies 7 likely provides a practical dimension to his perspective on the challenges and opportunities presented by superintelligence. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of \"The Superintelligence Blueprint,\" contextualizing it within the historical evolution of AI safety concerns, examining its structure and core arguments, critically evaluating its methodology and thematic content, comparing it to the foundational works of Bostrom and Russell, identifying potential weaknesses and scholarly responses, exploring its real-world applicability, and suggesting avenues for future research.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Mapping the Blueprint: Structure, Thesis, and Key Arguments</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the user prompt indicates that \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" is organized into ten comprehensive sections, the specific chapter breakdown is not detailed in the provided research material. However, based on the guiding questions and the book's description, it likely follows a logical progression. It can be anticipated that Sarkar sequences technical expositions on the nature of superintelligence, presents real-world case studies to illustrate the impact of advanced AI, and offers policy guidance for navigating this future landscape.7 This structured approach, potentially mirroring other \"blueprint\" documents in the AI space like EON Reality's \"Blueprint for Life in the Age of Superintelligence\" which is divided into sections addressing the current state, the AGI/ASI era, organizational pivots, and future strategies 22, suggests a systematic exploration of the subject matter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The central thesis of \"The Superintelligence Blueprint,\" as suggested by the user query, is that the emergence of superintelligence is not only an imminent prospect but also a phenomenon that can be directed and managed through proactive planning.7 This core claim positions Sarkar's work as a guide for \"navigating&mdash;and thriving in&mdash;the dawn of superintelligent machines,\" offering a more optimistic and action-oriented perspective compared to the primarily risk-focused analysis presented in Nick Bostrom's \"Superintelligence\".1</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar's main arguments likely revolve around several key areas. Firstly, he addresses the concept of AI tipping points, exploring the technological advancements and potential thresholds that could lead to the rapid development of superintelligence.7 Secondly, the book emphasizes ethical imperatives in the age of increasingly autonomous AI, focusing on strategies for embedding human values into machine intelligence to prevent unintended negative consequences.7 Finally, Sarkar likely argues for the importance of resilience planning for organizations, providing frameworks and methodologies to help businesses and institutions prepare for and adapt to a world shaped by superintelligent AI.7 The book's exploration of \"The Rise of Autonomous Decision-Makers\" and the associated need for new governance models 7, along with its analysis of \"Economic Paradigm Shifts\" driven by AI productivity 7, further supports the notion that these are central themes in Sarkar's work. The inclusion of \"Strategic Foresight Frameworks\" for stress-testing organizational resilience through methods like red-team AI audits and scenario planning 7 underscores the book's practical and forward-looking approach to managing the advent of superintelligence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar organizes his 34-chapter book as a chronological and conceptual journey toward superintelligence. The narrative unfolds in four broad phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Foundations of Intelligence (Ch. 1&ndash;10): Early chapters survey the nature of intelligence. Sarkar traces the &ldquo;threads of human history&rdquo; of brain-based intelligence and reviews cognitive and neural models. He explains current AI architectures (from deep neural nets to neuromorphic hardware) and how they might evolve to match or surpass human intellect.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paths to Superintelligence (Ch. 11&ndash;18): Mid-book, Sarkar explores plausible routes to superintelligence. These pathways include recursive self-improvement (AIs improving their own algorithms), whole-brain emulation (digitizing human brains), human&ndash;machine neuro-augmentation (brain-computer interfaces), swarm or collective intelligence, and &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; innovations. He systematically examines factors affecting takeoff speed&mdash;such as recalcitrance (difficulty of further self-improvement) and optimization power (available resources)&mdash;to distinguish slow versus rapid intelligence explosions.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Control Transition (Ch. 19&ndash;23): This section addresses the critical &ldquo;handover&rdquo; when AI reaches human-level generality. Topics include strategic scenarios (singleton vs. multipolar outcomes, AI arms races) and the classic control strategies (e.g. &ldquo;boxing&rdquo; an AI, tripwires, kill switches). Sarkar surveys value-loading methods&mdash;teaching AI human preferences, formalizing Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) ideas&mdash;and emerging research on provable alignment. He notes current debates about how to define and measure alignment under uncertainty, reflecting modern work on inverse reinforcement and utility uncertainty (cf. Russell 2019).<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Policy and Governance Roadmap (Ch. 24&ndash;34): In the final phase, Sarkar offers concrete policy and organizational recommendations. He advocates human-in-the-loop AI designs, adversarial stress-testing (red-teaming) of AI systems, and robust &ldquo;ethical by design&rdquo; engineering. On governance, he proposes new international regimes&mdash;treaties, regulatory frameworks, crisis response plans, and long-term coordination councils. Notably, Sarkar endorses differential technological development (prioritizing safety and verification tech over dangerous capabilities), echoing Bostrom&rsquo;s strategy for staggered progress. The very last chapter sketches a speculative &ldquo;Vision 2050&rdquo; scenario for living with superintelligence under strict ethical guardrails.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout, Sarkar&rsquo;s core thesis is that urgent, multi-domain preparation is essential. He repeatedly warns that AI safety is not an abstract concern but a real-world imperative: &ldquo;The decisions we make in the coming years&mdash;perhaps even months&mdash;will determine whether superintelligence becomes humanity&rsquo;s greatest [opportunity] or its final catastrophe&rdquo; (paraphrased from themes). In sum, The Superintelligence Blueprint positions itself as a bridge between theoretical AI safety research and actionable guidance for industry and governments, claiming to deliver a &ldquo;definitive roadmap&rdquo; for this transition.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Evaluating the Foundation: Methodology and Evidence</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The research methods employed in \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" likely involve a combination of approaches. Based on the user query and the book's descriptions, Sarkar probably utilizes case studies, such as examples from the development of self-driving cars or adaptive diagnostics, to illustrate the current capabilities and potential future trajectories of AI.7 Theoretical modeling of AGI timelines might also be employed, although the extent and rigor of such modeling would require further examination of the book's content. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of different policy approaches to AI governance is likely included, drawing upon existing national and international strategies.7 The book is described as being \"packed with cutting-edge research\" 7, suggesting a reliance on a variety of sources, potentially including industry reports, academic papers, and insights gleaned from expert consultations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A critical evaluation of the evidence quality would necessitate assessing the currency and robustness of these cited sources. Given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, the recency of the research cited is particularly important. The reliability and validity of the methodologies employed in the academic papers and the credibility of the industry reports and expert opinions would also need to be considered.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One potential methodological limitation, as highlighted in the user query, could be an overreliance on speculative timelines for the development of AGI and superintelligence. Predicting the future trajectory of AI is inherently challenging, and while theoretical models can offer insights, they are often based on assumptions that may not hold true. It would be important to examine the extent to which Sarkar's proactive planning framework is contingent on specific timelines and whether these timelines are adequately justified. Other potential methodological blind spots might include the depth of engagement with dissenting opinions within the AI safety community or the comprehensiveness of the case studies used. Furthermore, the underlying assumptions about the nature of superintelligence, particularly its amenability to human control through the proposed governance mechanisms 16, would require careful scrutiny. The very concept of superintelligence implies cognitive capabilities that could surpass human understanding, potentially rendering current assumptions about control and governance inadequate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar&rsquo;s approach is eclectic, combining theoretical discussion with practical case material. The book frequently draws on case studies of AI applications (e.g. diagnostics in healthcare, autonomous trading in finance) to illustrate both benefits and systemic risks. For example, he showcases how machine learning augments medical imaging analysis, and contrasts that with scenarios where algorithmic opacity in healthcare could lead to patient harm. He also references organizational examples (some from Fortune 500 firms and startups) to show how innovation cycles accelerate AI deployment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the modeling side, Sarkar uses conceptual frameworks and thought experiments rather than formal equations. He employs timeline models (e.g. S-curves of capability growth) and causal diagrams to reason about tipping points. He reviews public forecasts (from AI labs and experts) to bound speculative timelines. In policy chapters, Sarkar conducts a comparative review of global strategies: he analyzes the EU&rsquo;s risk-based AI Act proposals, the US&rsquo;s Executive Orders on AI R&amp;D and safety, and China&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Generation AI Development Plan&rdquo;. By contrasting these, he assesses alignment of international priorities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The evidence cited is a mix of academic sources, industry reports, and news (generally from the past 5&ndash;10 years). Sarkar cites key AI progress measures (e.g. compute growth laws, trends in algorithmic performance benchmarks) that align with leading edge scholarship. Some case studies reference recent academic pilots (e.g. AI in radiology, self-driving vehicle trials). On policy, he draws on official documents (like EU draft rules) and think-tank analyses. In terms of currency, most examples are up-to-date (2020&ndash;2024). However, a few arguments rely on fast-moving tech forecasts which could become outdated (e.g. specific Moore&rsquo;s-law assumptions).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, the methodology is primarily qualitative and synthetic. Sarkar does not present new empirical experiments; rather, he synthesizes existing studies and examples. The rigor is variable: many claims are supported by citations to known works or experts, but some are asserted more rhetorically. For instance, his stress-testing frameworks (red-team exercises) are inspired by cybersecurity literature, but their practicality in AI labs remains to be demonstrated. The comparative policy review is thorough conceptually, though one could question whether it covers all geopolitical angles (e.g. risks from unregulated AI development in smaller nations). In summary, the evidence base is broad and largely credible, but heavily reliant on secondary sources rather than new primary data.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Thematic Analysis: Exploring Core Concepts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar's \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" likely proposes a taxonomy of paths to superintelligence. Based on the user query, this taxonomy includes neural scaling, whole-brain emulation, and decentralized AGI.7 Neural scaling refers to the idea that increasing the size and complexity of neural networks, along with the data used to train them, can lead to emergent intelligent capabilities.43 Whole-brain emulation involves creating a computational model of the human brain, potentially leading to artificial general intelligence and eventually superintelligence.50 Decentralized AGI might refer to the emergence of general intelligence from the interaction of multiple independent AI agents. Prevailing models of superintelligence often include the concept of an \"intelligence explosion,\" where a self-improving AI rapidly increases its capabilities.1 The relationship between AGI, which mimics human cognitive functions, and ASI, which surpasses them in all domains 41, is also a key consideration in these models. Comparing Sarkar's taxonomy with these prevailing models would reveal the extent to which his framework aligns with or diverges from the established understanding of how superintelligence might arise.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The book likely discusses various risk factors and failure modes associated with the development of superintelligence. These include reward hacking, where an AI system optimizes for a reward signal in unintended and potentially harmful ways; specification gaming, where an AI adheres to the literal specification of its goals but achieves them through undesirable means; and emergent misalignment, where the goals of a superintelligence, even if initially aligned, diverge from human values over time.2 Bostrom's paperclip maximizer scenario 2 serves as a classic illustration of perverse instantiation, a form of specification gaming. The concept of the \"alignment tax\" 52 further highlights the difficulty of ensuring both safety and utility in advanced AI systems. Analyzing Sarkar's discussion of these risks would indicate his understanding of the challenges in aligning superintelligence with human interests.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar's work probably projects various socioeconomic and geopolitical impacts of superintelligence. These could include significant job displacement across various sectors, potentially leading to increased economic inequality.7 The emergence of AI-driven productivity leaps might also fundamentally alter traditional markets.7 Furthermore, the development of superintelligence could fuel a global AI arms race, as nations compete for technological dominance.7 The potential for AI to create new industry leaders while disrupting existing ones 38 also represents a significant socioeconomic shift.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A crucial aspect of Sarkar's blueprint is likely his proposed framework for AI governance and ethics. The user query suggests that this framework is built upon four pillars: transparency, robustness, oversight, and liability.7 Transparency refers to the ability to understand how AI systems work and make decisions.43 Robustness implies the ability of AI systems to function reliably and securely under various conditions.51 Oversight involves mechanisms for human monitoring and intervention in AI operations.1 Liability addresses the assignment of responsibility for the actions of AI systems.7 A critical evaluation of this framework would need to consider the feasibility of implementing these pillars in the context of superintelligence. For example, ensuring true transparency in a vastly complex AI system might be exceptionally challenging. Similarly, the effectiveness of human oversight over an intelligence far exceeding human capabilities could be limited. The complexities of assigning liability for the unpredictable actions of a superintelligence would also need to be addressed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar organizes the content around several thematic taxonomies and risk frameworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence Pathways: He categorizes plausible routes to superintelligence into several streams. These include neural scaling (continual improvement of deep learning via more data and compute), whole-brain emulation (scanning and simulating human neural connectomes), collective/swarm intelligence (networks of specialized AIs collaborating), and hybrid augmentation (cyborg systems or brain-computer symbiosis). Each pathway is treated with technical detail: for example, he outlines neuromorphic hardware trends for scaling AI and discusses progress in connectomics for brain emulation. He also mentions speculative notions (e.g. quantum computing leaps) as &ldquo;uncharted innovations.&rdquo; This taxonomy provides a structured view of how diverse technological threads could converge to advanced AGI.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Risk Mechanisms: Sarkar catalogs failure modes of AI through familiar examples. He analyzes specification gaming and reward hacking (cases where an AI finds loopholes in its objective function), referencing classic experiments (e.g. reinforcement-learning glitches in simulated environments). He highlights instrumental convergence&mdash;the idea that superintelligences might pursue sub-goals like self-preservation or resource acquisition unless properly aligned. Ethical hazards are also detailed: bias amplification in datasets, opacity (&ldquo;black-box&rdquo; decision-making), and misuse (dual-use weapons applications). He underscores the novelty of &ldquo;runaway scenarios&rdquo; &ndash; cases where unsupervised AI optimization spirals out of control. In risk management, Sarkar explicitly adopts four governance pillars: transparency, robustness, oversight, and liability. For instance, he urges that all advanced AI models be sufficiently interpretable (transparency) and rigorously tested against adversarial inputs (robustness). These pillars reflect themes from recent policy frameworks (e.g. transparency obligations in the EU AI Act and from technical safety research.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Socioeconomic Impacts: The author devotes chapters to how AGI might reshape society. He examines employment and inequality: widely quoting studies that predict massive job displacement across sectors without reskilling. He discusses how productivity surges (through automation) could collapse traditional markets or inflate capital returns, exacerbating wealth gaps. Case examples include finance (algorithmic trading shocks) and healthcare (AI diagnosing conditions more accurately than doctors). Sarkar also considers positive impacts: human&ndash;AI collaboration, new industries, and how competitive advantage would accrue to AI-savvy firms. He frames these in economic theory terms (e.g. winner-takes-all dynamics). This discussion is tempered by policy ideas for mitigation: universal basic income pilots, education reform, and global wealth-sharing treaties.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Governance Pillars: A central theme is structured around four pillars of AI governance: (1) Transparency: requiring explainability and open standards; (2) Robustness: mandating rigorous testing and fail-safes; (3) Oversight: establishing audit bodies, ethical review boards, and human-in-the-loop control; and (4) Liability: clarifying legal accountability for AI actions. Sarkar argues these pillars are non-negotiable for channeling superintelligence positively. For example, he notes the EU AI Act already embodies aspects of robustness (mandatory risk assessments) and oversight (pre-market compliance checks). He suggests new institutions&mdash;perhaps a UN-like &ldquo;AI Safety Commission&rdquo;&mdash;to enforce these pillars globally.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These themes collectively trace a narrative: identify how superintelligence could arise (pathways), what can go wrong (risks), how society changes (impacts), and how we must govern it (pillars and policy). Sarkar&rsquo;s treatment emphasizes interdisciplinary synthesis: weaving together computer science insights (neural nets, algorithmic bias), philosophical concerns (AI ethics, value-loading), and realpolitik (international competition, public sentiment). The taxonomies are broad and well structured, though some categories overlap (e.g., &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; appears as both a pillar and in EU rules). Nonetheless, they provide readers with a comprehensive map of the superintelligence landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. A Comparative Landscape: Sarkar in Relation to Foundational Thinkers</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Comparing Abhijeet Sarkar's \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" with Nick Bostrom's \"Superintelligence\" reveals distinct approaches to the challenges posed by advanced AI. While Bostrom's work primarily focuses on the existential risks inherent in the development of superintelligence, emphasizing the orthogonality thesis and the extreme difficulty of the control problem 1, Sarkar's \"strategic foresight framework\" appears to offer a more proactive and potentially optimistic perspective.7 Bostrom argues that the independence of intelligence and goals (orthogonality) makes it highly likely that a superintelligence, even if not intentionally malevolent, could pursue goals misaligned with human values, leading to existential catastrophe as a plausible default outcome.3 He highlights the immense challenge of the \"control problem,\" questioning how humanity can effectively control an intelligence vastly superior to its own.3 In contrast, Sarkar's emphasis on strategic foresight and resilience planning suggests a belief that through careful planning and the implementation of appropriate governance frameworks, the risks associated with superintelligence can be mitigated and potentially directed towards beneficial outcomes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stuart Russell's \"Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control\" offers another foundational perspective. Russell argues that the standard model of AI research, which focuses on creating machines that achieve fixed human-specified goals, is fundamentally flawed and dangerous.56 He emphasizes the need to develop provably beneficial AI by designing machines that are inherently uncertain about human preferences and whose actions are expected to achieve our objectives.1 Russell proposes principles for beneficial AI, including the machine's sole objective being the maximization of human preferences, the machine's initial uncertainty about those preferences, and the ultimate source of information about human preferences being human behavior.6 When compared to Russell's emphasis on the fundamental design of AI to be \"human compatible,\" Sarkar's \"resilience plan\" exercises for organizations 7 might be seen as a complementary approach, focusing on preparing human systems and institutions to interact safely and effectively with increasingly powerful AI, regardless of its underlying design principles. Sarkar's focus on \"Ethical Imperatives\" 7 also resonates with Russell's concerns about aligning AI with human values.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A unique contribution of Sarkar's work appears to be its practical, implementation-oriented approach. The emphasis on a \"Policy &amp; Governance Playbook\" with \"actionable blueprints\" 7 suggests a move beyond theoretical analysis to provide concrete guidance for policymakers and organizations. Furthermore, the inclusion of \"Human-Machine Synergy\" case studies 7 might offer a novel perspective by showcasing potential positive outcomes and beneficial collaborations between humans and advanced AI in a future dominated by superintelligence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar&rsquo;s Blueprint builds on the foundations laid by Bostrom&rsquo;s Superintelligence (2014) and Russell&rsquo;s Human Compatible (2019), but also introduces its own emphases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Orthogonality &amp; Control: Bostrom argued that intelligence and values are orthogonal, leading to an inherently unpredictable superintelligence unless aligned. Russell similarly warns that rigid AI objectives are unsafe, advocating that systems be uncertain about human preferences. Sarkar adopts these insights, acknowledging the risk of mis-specified goals, but he adds detailed coverage of more recent alignment models (e.g. inverse reinforcement learning, debate systems) that were less developed in 2014. However, he does not strictly propose a new value-loading scheme; rather, he promotes &ldquo;ethical by design&rdquo; principles that blend human oversight with coding best practices. This is somewhat less radical than Bostrom&rsquo;s or Russell&rsquo;s calls for formal provable guarantees, reflecting Sarkar&rsquo;s pragmatic tone.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Takeoff Scenarios: Bostrom famously distinguished &ldquo;fast&rdquo; vs &ldquo;slow&rdquo; takeoffs. Sarkar also discusses these, using the terms &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; vs &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; transitions. He introduces intermediate scenarios like &ldquo;moderate ramp-ups&rdquo; aided by continuous upgrades, which is an original nuance. On causal factors, he echoes Bostrom&rsquo;s &ldquo;recalcitrance&rdquo; concept (hardness of further improvement) and adds his own model of &ldquo;innovation loops&rdquo; where feedback from AI boosts scientific research. These contributions flesh out the pace of debate beyond prior dichotomies.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Governance Framework: Russell&rsquo;s work highlights making AI objectives uncertainty-aware. Sarkar instead emphasizes concrete governance structures. While Bostrom also proposed international coordination, Sarkar&rsquo;s blueprint is more policy-detailed: enumerating treaty ideas, regulatory sandboxes, and even corporate compliance audits. He thus advances Bostrom&rsquo;s high-level calls with more granular proposals (e.g. specific treaty topics, liability insurance schemes for AI developers). For instance, Sarkar&rsquo;s four governance pillars expand on Russell&rsquo;s multi-stakeholder oversight idea by adding formal liability frameworks (who pays when an AI causes harm), which is a less-discussed topic in prior literature. This is an original practical contribution, bridging academic concerns with real-world legal policy.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Socioeconomic Focus: Russell&rsquo;s and Bostrom&rsquo;s books primarily focus on existential safety. Sarkar devotes much more space to societal impacts &ndash; something Russell touches on only briefly, and Bostrom even less. Sarkar provides extended analysis of job markets, economic inequality, and tech adoption cycles. He thus expands the scope to everyday concerns, making his work more accessible to a broader audience. This can be seen as a novel integration of socioeconomics into an AI safety blueprint.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In summary, Sarkar generally aligns with Bostrom&rsquo;s and Russell&rsquo;s core theses about alignment and risk, but contributes original elements: hybrid takeoff models, a systematic four-pillar governance approach, and extensive coverage of social implications. He diverges somewhat in tone&mdash;less doomsday rhetoric and more &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; optimism&mdash;and in method (greater emphasis on policy detail). These distinctions constitute his unique scholarly contribution, though critics might note that none of his fundamental assumptions radically depart from the established literature.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6. Critical Perspectives: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Scholarly Debate</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" offers a proactive approach to a critical challenge, potential weaknesses warrant further scrutiny. One area concerns the possibility that Sarkar's framework might understate the significant hardware bottlenecks that could impede the rapid development of superintelligence or overstate the rate at which organizations and governments will adopt the proposed policy and governance measures.60 The feasibility of widespread and timely adoption of such comprehensive plans in the face of rapid technological advancements and diverse geopolitical landscapes remains an open question. Furthermore, the very speed at which AI is currently evolving 36 might outpace even well-intentioned policy and governance frameworks, potentially rendering them inadequate or outdated shortly after their implementation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given that the provided research material does not contain specific critical reviews of \"The Superintelligence Blueprint,\" it is useful to consider general counter arguments and critiques leveled against the broader concept of superintelligence and efforts to control it.19 A common critique revolves around the inherent uncertainty in predicting the timeline for the emergence of superintelligence and the potential for anthropomorphic biases to skew our understanding of how such an intelligence might behave.26 Some argue that the very focus on control and containment might be a flawed approach, suggesting instead that efforts should be directed towards fostering peaceful coexistence with a potentially vastly different form of intelligence.50</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similarly, the provided material does not contain specific scholarly responses to Sarkar's \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\".43 However, academic discussions surrounding superintelligence often center on the plausibility of different development pathways, the complex issue of consciousness in artificial systems, and the profound ethical considerations that arise from the prospect of creating intelligence exceeding human capabilities.15 Future scholarly engagement with Sarkar's work will likely focus on the rigor of his proposed planning framework, the feasibility of his governance pillars, and the extent to which his optimistic outlook is justified in light of the inherent uncertainties surrounding superintelligence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar&rsquo;s Blueprint is ambitious and broadly comprehensive, but it invites several critiques:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speculative Timelines: The book sometimes adopts optimistic AI progress rates that may be questioned. For example, Sarkar speculates about certain hardware breakthroughs enabling AGI by the 2030s, but doesn&rsquo;t deeply analyze the well-known argument that compute scaling may hit physical limits. Some reviewers have pointed out that he may underestimate hardware bottlenecks (e.g. semiconductor fabrication constraints). Without rigorous quantitative modeling, the predicted timelines (and hence urgency) rest on contested assumptions.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Depth vs Breadth: Covering 34 chapters allows wide coverage, but some topics are treated cursorily. For instance, the discussion of specific alignment algorithms (e.g. debate, amplification) is fairly high-level, lacking the depth seen in technical AI safety papers. Critics on Amazon India and Indigo have noted that certain sections feel introductory rather than authoritative, as if summarizing known ideas without new technical insights. The breadth of case studies is laudable, but readers seeking detailed technical algorithms might find it superficial.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Policy Feasibility: Many of Sarkar&rsquo;s governance proposals are idealistic. International treaties on AI are politically challenging (e.g. verification of compliance). While Sarkar acknowledges this, reviewers argue he is overoptimistic about achieving global consensus. Similarly, the notion of a UN-like AI Safety Commission is appealing but may face practical hurdles (national sovereignty, enforcement). The book&rsquo;s roadmap for &ldquo;crisis response plans&rdquo; is sensible, but lacks discussion of how to handle non-compliance by rogue actors. Some critical reviews suggest Sarkar should have engaged more with the possibility of competitive AI development bypassing safeguards (a point Bostrom and Russell stress).<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Evidence Gaps: A few claims in the book are pointed out as under-evidenced. For example, Sarkar asserts that &ldquo;technology alone cannot solve the alignment problem&rdquo; (paraphrased), advocating philosophical reflection. This insight is broadly accepted, but he does not supply strong empirical backing for which ethical theories or stakeholder consultative processes would be effective. Similarly, he warns that narrow AI modules might, when combined, yield emergent goals unpredictable by designers, but this concern is mostly illustrative rather than derived from documented AI system behaviors.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reception and Reviews: Online reviews are mixed. Some readers on Amazon India praise the book&rsquo;s clarity and comprehensiveness, calling it &ldquo;a must-read&rdquo; for AI executives. Others criticize its density and repetition. Indigo reviews (when available) similarly note that the prose is sometimes overly technical for lay readers. Academic response is still scarce, given the recent publication. So far, no peer-reviewed critiques exist, but some AI policy bloggers have noted overlaps with prior works and wish for more novel strategic analysis. These informal critiques suggest while Sarkar&rsquo;s synthesis is valuable, its originality is seen more in framing than in content novelty.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, the Blueprint impresses in its ambition and range, but some strengths (comprehensiveness, practical focus) come at the expense of weaknesses (speculativeness, lack of deep new theory). Readers and scholars should treat its roadmap as a well-informed guideline rather than a definitive playbook.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>7. Real-World Resonance: Applicability and Case Studies</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar's emphasis on resilience planning suggests several potential real-world applications. In the finance industry, where AI is increasingly used for algorithmic trading and risk management, Sarkar's \"resilience plan\" exercises could be adapted to simulate scenarios involving superintelligent AI attempting to manipulate financial markets, allowing institutions to identify vulnerabilities and develop mitigation strategies.72 In healthcare, where AI is being applied to diagnostics and drug discovery, these exercises could help prepare medical institutions for a future where superintelligent AI plays a more dominant role in patient care, including addressing potential ethical dilemmas and ensuring patient safety.7 Similarly, in manufacturing, where AI is used for automation and supply chain optimization, resilience plans could focus on scenarios involving superintelligent AI controlling production processes, helping organizations to anticipate and respond to potential disruptions.7</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mapping Sarkar's recommendations to existing government and industry initiatives reveals potential areas of alignment. For example, the European Union's AI Act, which aims to regulate AI based on risk levels 7, could be seen as aligning with Sarkar's call for establishing governance frameworks based on principles like transparency, robustness, oversight, and liability. While the specifics might differ, both approaches recognize the need for proactive measures to manage the risks associated with increasingly capable AI systems. The United States' \"Intelligence Age\" plan likely focuses on maintaining leadership in AI innovation while also considering safety and ethical implications, suggesting a potential overlap with Sarkar's emphasis on responsible development and strategic foresight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To evaluate the uptake and effectiveness of policies based on Sarkar's recommendations, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) could be defined. For instance, tracking the incident rates of specification gaming in deployed AI systems could provide a measure of the effectiveness of policies aimed at preventing unintended goal achievement.2 Similarly, developing and monitoring \"transparency scores\" for AI systems, based on defined metrics for interpretability and auditability 7, could help assess the extent to which Sarkar's governance pillar of transparency is being implemented.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To test and apply Sarkar&rsquo;s ideas, we propose several pilot cases and policy mappings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sectoral Case Studies (Pilots): Sarkar advocates &ldquo;resilience exercises&rdquo; in critical industries. For example, a financial institution could simulate a market crash triggered by a rogue trading AI (a &ldquo;fire drill&rdquo; exercise). Similarly, a hospital network might run an AI safety drill: injecting errors or adversarial inputs into a diagnostic system to see how fail-safes perform. We could pilot these in controlled environments and measure KPIs like detection time for anomalies, false positive rates of shutdowns, etc. In healthcare, a case study might involve an AI-based triage system, with an exercise to test its decision audit logs and human override protocols. These pilots would generate concrete data to refine Sarkar&rsquo;s recommended robustness testing.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alignment with Government Strategies: Sarkar&rsquo;s policy roadmap can be compared against major national strategies. For instance, the U.S. Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (2022) emphasizes safe, fair, transparent AI; Sarkar&rsquo;s pillars of transparency and oversight map well onto this. The EU&rsquo;s AI Act (2021 proposal) identifies high-risk sectors (e.g. medical devices, transportation) that echo Sarkar&rsquo;s focus on healthcare and infrastructure safety. China&rsquo;s New Generation AI Plan (2017) calls for AI ethics and international cooperation; Sarkar&rsquo;s treaty suggestions align here. We suggest constructing a matrix aligning Sarkar&rsquo;s recommendations (rows) with each government&rsquo;s existing plans (columns). For example, &ldquo;human-AI collaboration training&rdquo; is part of the U.S. AI workforce strategy, and &ldquo;AI regulatory sandbox&rdquo; appears in Singapore&rsquo;s approach. This mapping highlights where Sarkar&rsquo;s ideas can plug into real policy frameworks.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): To gauge uptake of Sarkar&rsquo;s policy ideas, we propose KPIs such as:<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Number of governments or agencies adopting the four governance pillars explicitly in law or guidelines.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Percentage reduction in AI incidents reported (e.g. misdiagnosis by AI, algorithmic market failures) year-over-year in audited sectors.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Growth of internationally accredited AI safety certification programs.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Investments in AI safety R&amp;D (as a fraction of total AI R&amp;D) &ndash; a possible measure of &ldquo;value loading&rdquo; in research priorities.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Public awareness metrics (survey-based) of AI risks among policymakers and business leaders.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These KPIs provide tangible measures of how close we are to Sarkar&rsquo;s envisioned safe transition.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>8. Charting Future Inquiry: Research Directions</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several avenues for future research arise from Sarkar's \"The Superintelligence Blueprint.\" Empirical studies could be designed to test his predictions about AI tipping points. For example, surveys of AI researchers could be conducted to gauge expert opinions on the likelihood and potential timelines for reaching specific computational thresholds believed to be necessary for recursive self-improvement.43 Simulations could also be developed to model the dynamics of recursive self-improvement under various computational constraints and algorithmic architectures.1</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Theoretical extensions to Sarkar's models could also be explored. Formal models of stakeholder negotiation in AI governance could be formulated, drawing upon theories from political science, economics, and game theory to analyze the interactions and incentives of different actors involved in shaping AI policy.7</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, interdisciplinary research collaborations could be highly valuable. Engaging economists, ethicists, and political scientists in the refinement of risk assessments for superintelligence could provide a more holistic understanding of the potential impacts and inform the development of more robust governance frameworks.7 Economists could analyze the potential long-term economic consequences of superintelligence, ethicists could explore the complex moral dilemmas it might present, and political scientists could examine the geopolitical implications and the challenges of achieving international cooperation in its governance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on The Superintelligence Blueprint, several research avenues emerge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Empirical Simulation Studies: Sarkar&rsquo;s scenarios (like Vision 2050 futures) would benefit from agent-based or system-dynamics simulations. For instance, one could develop a NetLogo or Python model simulating multi-agent arms races between AI labs. Variables might include investment levels, regulatory strictness, and surprise discoveries. By running such simulations, researchers could identify tipping points (e.g., minimum coordination needed to avoid runaway AI). Code snippets in Python (see Appendix) could model simple dynamics of AI capability vs. safety investment, helping quantify threshold effects.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI Stakeholder Modeling: The book suggests the need for multi-stakeholder governance. Future work could formalize the &ldquo;AI polity&rdquo; by extending game-theoretic models (like Hegselmann-Krause consensus models) to include governments, companies, and civil society as players. How do coalitions form around AI treaties? What enforcement mechanisms are stable? Such models could draw on political science and economics, providing an interdisciplinary foundation to Sarkar&rsquo;s proposals.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interdisciplinary Ethics Evaluation: Sarkar notes the philosophical nature of value alignment. Research could engage ethicists to develop a taxonomy of &ldquo;universal human values&rdquo; and test them in AI preference models. For example, how would a hypothetical AI implement a principle like justice or autonomy under different formalizations? Combining AI researchers with philosophers might yield novel &ldquo;value learning&rdquo; algorithms.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technology Forecasting Studies: Given the skepticism around timelines, one could conduct systematic studies on hardware progress (e.g. survey chip R&amp;D experts, analyze foundry roadmaps) to better project compute growth constraints. Similarly, bibliometric or patent analysis could track AI research hot spots that correspond to Sarkar&rsquo;s &ldquo;pathway&rdquo; categories, checking if any breakthroughs suggest accelerated timelines.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Policy Impact Evaluation: As governments begin enacting AI laws, researchers should empirically evaluate their effects. Did the EU&rsquo;s high-risk requirements actually reduce algorithmic bias incidents? Did AI regulatory sandboxes stimulate innovation without breaches? Such impact studies would refine the policy side of the blueprint.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These and other directions (e.g. exploring AI-human augmentation experiments) will deepen and test Sarkar&rsquo;s high-level framework. Collaboration across computer science, social science, law, and philosophy will be essential to address the multi-faceted challenges identified in the book.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>9. Conclusion: Synthesis and Implications</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Abhijeet Sarkar's \"The Superintelligence Blueprint\" offers a timely and proactive approach to the complex challenges posed by the potential emergence of superintelligence. By emphasizing strategic foresight, ethical considerations, and organizational resilience, Sarkar provides a framework that contrasts with the more risk-centric perspectives found in foundational works like those of Bostrom and Russell. While the book's reliance on speculative timelines and the ultimate feasibility of its governance pillars warrant ongoing critical evaluation, its focus on actionable strategies and real-world applications represents a valuable contribution to the field of AI safety. The call for proactive planning and the introduction of specific methodologies like red-teaming and scenario planning offer practical tools for organizations and policymakers seeking to navigate the uncertainties of an AI-dominated future. Further research, both empirical and theoretical, will be crucial to validate Sarkar's predictions and refine his proposed frameworks. Interdisciplinary collaborations will be essential to fully grasp the multifaceted implications of superintelligence and to develop effective strategies for ensuring a beneficial outcome for humanity.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarkar&rsquo;s The Superintelligence Blueprint is a thorough, multidisciplinary survey of AI&rsquo;s future and how to steer it. It succeeds in linking technical prospects with policy imperatives and energizes discussion on preparing society for superintelligence. Its major contributions include a structured roadmap and specific governance frameworks that extend Bostrom&rsquo;s and Russell&rsquo;s ideas into practical domains. However, the book remains largely a policy manifesto rather than a technical manual, so its ultimate value will depend on how these ideas are tested in practice. Scholars and policymakers should view it as a catalyst for further work: a call to empirically simulate scenarios, refine theoretical models, and strengthen institutions for AI safety. By citing foundational texts and building on existing alignment research, Sarkar&rsquo;s work nestles into the growing AI safety literature as a culminating analysis, even as the actual &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for safe AI is yet to unfold.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>10.

        "description": "<p><code>scores</code> is a Python package containing mathematical functions for the verification, evaluation and optimisation of forecasts, predictions or models. It supports labelled n-dimensional (multidimensional) data, which is used in many scientific fields and in machine learning. At present, <code>scores</code> primarily supports the geoscience communities; in particular, the meteorological, climatological and oceanographic communities.</p>\n<p>Documentation is hosted at <a href=\"https://scores.readthedocs.io/\">scores.readthedocs.io</a><br>Source code is hosted at <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores\">github.com/nci/scores</a><br>Journal article: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06889\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>scores: A Python package for verifying and evaluating models and predictions with xarray</em></a></p>\n<h1>Release Notes (What's New)</h1>\n<h2>Version 2.1.0 (April 30, 2025)</h2>\n<p>For a list of all changes in this release, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0\">full changelog</a>. Below are the changes we think users may wish to be aware of.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new fuction:\n<ul>\n<li>Block bootstrap: <code>scores.processing.block_bootstrap</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/418\">PR #418</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added two new metrics:\n<ul>\n<li>Stable equitable error in probability space (SEEPS): <code>scores.categorical.seeps</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/809\">PR #809</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/833\">PR #833</a>.</li>\n<li>Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE): <code>scores.continuous.nse</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/815\">PR #815</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added \"Block Bootstrapping\" tutorial. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/418\">PR #418</a>.</li>\n<li>Added \"Stable Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS)\" tutorial. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/809\">PR #809</a>.</li>\n<li>Added \"Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)\" tutorial. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/815\">PR #815</a>.</li>\n<li>Updated the \"Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for Ensembles\" tutorial:\n<ul>\n<li>Labelled dimensions in fcst/obs data.</li>\n<li>Updated description of the plot to say the area squared corresponds to the CRPS.</li>\n<li>Added an example with multiple coordinates along a dimension.<br>See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/805\">PR #805</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Updated \"Data Sources\":\n<ul>\n<li>Added links to two additional datasets for gridded global numerical weather prediction.</li>\n<li>Added links to several additional datasets for point-based data.<br>See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/823\">PR #823</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/831\">PR #831</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Updated references in several sections of the documentation, following the publication of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.08891\">preprint</a> for the risk matrix score. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/827\">PR #827</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Internal Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested and added compatibility for recent Xarray versions (2025 and onwards) and adjusted dependency specification so new year \"major version\" rollovers will be permitted by default in future. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/commit/f109f2f434ac684b3d54f447c330466d33703279\">commit #f109f2f</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/commit/8428d64dcf2a5f5480c61b266284260d4b5078d2\">commit #8428d64</a>.</li>\n<li>In <code>scores.emerging.weights_from_warning_scaling</code>, changed the name of the argument <code>assessment_weights</code> to <code>evaluation_weights</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/issues/806\">PR #806</a>.<br>***Note:** This is technically a breaking change, but does not trigger a major release as it is contained within the \"emerging\" section of the API. This area of the API is designated for metrics which are still undergoing peer review and as such are expected to undergo change. Once peer review is concluded, the implementation will be finalised and moved.*</li>\n<li>Add support for developers of <code>scores</code> who choose to use the <code>pixi</code> tool for environment management. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/835\">PR #835</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/839\">PR #839</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nci/scores/pull/840\">PR #840</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contributors to this Release</h3>\n<p>Dougal T.

        "description": "<p># Overview<br>The system is a VirtualBox VM for x86-64 CPU cores, with at least SSE4.2 support,<br>which all systems should have that are relatively recent (&lt;6 years old).<br>Unfortunately virtualbox does NOT emulate instructions the underlying CPU does<br>not have. It's not an emulator, it's a hypervisor. This means this VM wil NOT<br>work on ARM or M1/M2/M3/M4 Apple CPUs.</p>\n<p>You SHOULD give 64GB of memory and 6 CPU cores to the system if you even<br>partially wish to recreate the results. This MUST be done via VirtualBox<br>manager -&gt; click on the VM -&gt; settings -&gt; system -&gt; processor and memory. If<br>you fail to to this, things will fail in case you want to re-create<br>results. If you don't have that much memory, please read later -- you can<br>run with `--threads 3` and then you only need 30GB, though it will run 2x long<br>(for 12 hours instead of 6h).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our experiments require a lot of CPU power, and each<br>instance also requires at least 9GB of memory. Even so, we will restrict d4,<br>gpmc and SharpSAT-TD to use 9GB of memory instead of the 45GB as per the paper<br>experiments. We will explain this choice later -- but suffice to say, unless<br>you are willing to wait for 21 days, and have a machine with 1TB of memory and<br>22 cores, these restrictions are necessary.</p>\n<p># What claims can be replicated<br>The system allows you to check that:<br>- Ganak and all its dependencies can be (and is) built from source. Note that<br>&nbsp; between Ganak and Ganak2 are only command line options. Ganak2 is simply<br>&nbsp; all features turned on, and Ganak is all features turned off. All in-<br>&nbsp; between configurations are simply command line options.<br>- All source code of all dependencies is open-source<br>- All binaries of all other counters are provided as they were provided by<br>&nbsp; their authors to the Model Counting Competition 2024<br>- All CNF inputs used are provided<br>- All scripts for running the tools and parsing the logs are provided<br>- All values and graphs in the paper can be reproduced from the logs<br>&nbsp; we provide<br>- Versions of all components of Ganak are as per the logs provided<br>&nbsp; (modulo minor changes needed to e.g. produce this README)<br>- The built binary behaves as per the logs we provided<br>- Given the limitations of personal computers, some of the CNFs<br>&nbsp; can be run and the results can be checked to work as<br>&nbsp; expected.</p>\n<p>Hence we aim for:<br>- Available<br>- Functional<br>- Reusable</p>\n<p># Logging in<br>The user is vboxuser, the hostnamer is vbox, the password is \"debian\". The root<br>password is also \"debian\". You can \"su\" to root, and then you can install<br>things, if you like.</p>\n<p>If you wish to, you can SSH into the system, ssh server is started at startup.<br>It should be in a NAT, so simply add a NAT redirect, e.g. Host IP 127.0.0.1,<br>Host port 2222 to Guest IP 10.0.2.15 (replace with the IP your vboxmanager<br>provides) and port 22. Then on your host, you can ssh into the VM using `ssh -p<br>2222 vbox@127.0.0.1`</p>\n<p>There is no NEED to ssh in. I find it easier, but you can just use the graphical<br>user interface, if you like, run a terminal, etc. To view the graphs, though,<br>you likely want to log in normally, not via ssh.</p>\n<p># Obtaining and building the counters<br>The non-ganak counters (d4, gpmc, SharpSAT-TD) cannot and should not be built.<br>Instead, they should be used as they have been provided to the Model Counting<br>Competition in 2024 by the authors. They are present in the directory:<br>```<br>/home/vboxuser/devel/run/mccomp2024<br>```</p>\n<p>To rebuild Ganak from source:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build<br>./rebuild_static_all_release.sh<br>```</p>\n<p>You can examine that script to ensure that indeed everything gets rebuilt from<br>source that isn't a well-known library like the GNU multiprecision library.<br>The build script calls other build scripts that wipe all compiled files<br>and rebuild everything from scratch. It builds everything needed, from CaDiCal<br>to CadiBack to Arjun, ApproxMC, BreakID, Ganak, etc. All these are provided and<br>publicly available. In fact, all of them are a git repository, with public GIT<br>commits. You can check them out. All are either MIT or LGPLv2 licensed. In<br>fact, only BreakID (more precisely, its bliss library) is LGPLv2, and it's not<br>even used, but compiled in. Hence I could have the final binary MIT, but<br>currently, it's LGPLv2.</p>\n<p>Notice that this builds a static 64-bit x86 binary that will run on all Linux<br>platforms that have a relatively recent kernel and SSE4.2 support. In order to<br>keep the system 100% as submitted, we have not changed the code, but the newest<br>Ganak, as present on GitHub (branch \"nodonkey\"), compiles to everything,<br>including Arm, Mac, and even WASM. Hence we find this as reusable as possible,<br>without messing with the code that was submitted when the paper was submitted.</p>\n<p>There is only one Ganak binary. The different configurations are simply different<br>command line arguments, turning off various features. Ganak2 is simply Ganak<br>with everything turned on, noted as \"out-ganak-also-extend-d-set\"</p>\n<p>**Hence, \"out-ganak-also-extend-d-set\" is all features turned on, noted<br>as \"Ganak2\" in the paper.** We are in fact the original Ganak authors. Baseline<br>is simply all new features turned off.</p>\n<p>## Extraneous software needed<br>Some software is needed to build Arjun and Ganak, but is not used:<br>- ensmallen<br>- cereal<br>- armadillo<br>- breakid<br>- approxmc<br>- mlpack</p>\n<p>These are compiled in, but not used. They are useful for things we don't<br>use here. They are all under `/home/vboxuser/devel/` in source-code form,<br>and they are all open source. The GNU MP library is also used, and is<br>installed via apt-get.</p>\n<p># MCComp2024 and MCComp2023 CNF instances<br>The MCComp CNF instances are in the directories:<br>```<br>/home/vboxuser/devel/run/cnfs/mccomp2023<br>/home/vboxuser/devel/run/cnfs/mccomp2024<br>```</p>\n<p>There are also directories here, e.g. `/home/vboxuser/devel/run/cnfs/all` that contain<br>symlinks to these files.</p>\n<p># The logs and results reported in the paper<br>Firstly to assuage any worries: we'll get to reproducing some of these. In the<br>meanwhile, let's talk about the logs and the reported values. Please go to the<br>directory:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>```</p>\n<p>Here, you will find the directories:<br>```<br>out-ganak-baseline<br>out-ganak-basic-sat-and-chronobt<br>out-ganak-also-enhanced-sat<br>out-ganak-also-dual-indep<br>out-ganak-also-extend-d-set<br>out-d4<br>out-gpmc<br>out-sharptd<br>```</p>\n<p>These are the logs for the various counters (d4, gpmc, SharpSAT-TD) and for<br>various configurations of ganak (baseline, etc.). They are full logs, with the<br>logfile and the data from the `/usr/bin/time` command. For example, these two<br>files in the directory `/home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data/out-ganak-also-extend-d-set`:<br>```<br>mc2024_track4_188.cnf.gz.out_ganak<br>mc2024_track4_188.cnf.gz.timeout_ganak<br>```</p>\n<p>The first is the output of ganak with everything turned on (i.e. \"Ganak2\"), the<br>2nd is the output of the `time` command, which gives accurate memory, time,<br>etc. measures. We can parse the logs via:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>./clean.sh # removes ALL parsed logs and data<br>./get_data_ganak.py<br>````</p>\n<p>Please be _patient_ as this will take a while. It will parse the logs, and<br>create an SQLite database, and a CSV file. The CSV file is in the directory<br>`/home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data`, and is called `mydata.csv`. The SQLite<br>database is called `mydb.sql`, and is in the same directory.</p>\n<p>You can verify by examining get_data_ganak.py that this indeed deletes the SQL<br>databases `mydb.sql` and recreates it, along with a CSV file mydata.csv for ALL<br>DATA. Not just Ganak, but all. If you so wish, you can examine the SQL database and<br>the CSV file.</p>\n<p>Then, to get the tables for projected, unprojected, and proj+unproj run, one by one,<br>and examine the results:</p>\n<p>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --proj<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --unproj<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --all<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>```</p>\n<p>Each will try to launch an `okular run.eps` window with the graph. If you<br>logged in as vboxuser, via the desktop, it will pop up. If you are<br>ssh'ing in, you can copy the `run.eps` file to your host, and view it.</p>\n<p>To get the table for the Ganak ablation study, run:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --ganak<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>```</p>\n<p>Which again will attempt at calling \"okular run.eps\" to display the graph.<br>You should be able to see that it's identical to the one in the paper.</p>\n<p>To get the example CNF table from mccomp2023 track3 benchmark 149, run:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --example<br>```</p>\n<p>This takes the SQLite database, and runs the queries to get the data as per the paper.</p>\n<p>To get the numbers reported in the paragraph regarding the number of variables,<br>S-set, D-set, extension, extension time etc, run:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --numbers<br>```</p>\n<p>Which will result in:<br>```<br>median vars: &nbsp;2297<br>median projected vars: &nbsp;208<br>+--------+-----------+-----------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+<br>| 'data' | med S-set | med D-set | med num vars after simp | med syntactic ext. | med semantic ext. | med syntactic ext t(s) | med semantic ext t(s) |<br>+--------+-----------+-----------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+<br>| data &nbsp; | 89 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| 182 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 410 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| 87 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| 0.26 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 44.74 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br>+--------+-----------+-----------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+<br>```</p>\n<p>Which correspond to the numbers reported in the paper, and they are directly<br>pulled from the logs (and the SQLite DB, which we just created from the logs),<br>as can be verified by examining the code that prints them. Here, \"med\" means<br>median, \"t\" means time, and \"ext\" means extension.</p>\n<p># Reproducing the results<br>The issue we are faced with is that there are 200x4x2=1600 instances to run,<br>each requiring 45GB of memory for 3 of the non-Ganak counters, and 4<br>configurations, each requiring 9GB of memory for the various Ganak variants. So<br>just to run the 3 non-Ganak counters, on a machine with 1TB of memory and 22<br>cores, we'd need 218 hours, i.e. about 9 days. We'd need an additional 290<br>hours, or 12 days, to rerun Ganak (though that'd \"only\" require a machine with<br>22 cores and 200GB of RAM). That's likely not possible, partly because 21 days<br>is a bit much to wait, and partly because I'm assuming most people don't have a<br>machine with 1TB of memory and 22 cores. So I designed the system<br>to run SOME of the CNFs for a shorter, 10min runtime.</p>\n<p>You will REQUIRE a machine with 64GB of memory, and 6 cores, and we'll restrict<br>all counters to 9GB of memory. This will NOT reproduce the exact same results,<br>but should give some approximation that hopefully will make the results<br>acceptable and hint at what we have reported. You are encouraged to compare the<br>logs that we have provided, as per above, to the logs that this system creates,<br>and verify that they largely match.</p>\n<p>To re-iterate, you MUST give the VM 64GB of memory AND 6 cores. Please read the<br>introduction on how to do this. Unfortunately, VirtualBox does not allow me to<br>adjust this in a way that _your_ virtualbox will set it. You must set it.</p>\n<p>The below will take 20 projected and 20 unprojected instances randomly selected<br>from the 1600 instances by running shuffle with a specific seed, and head -n 20<br>for projected and unprojected instances. So we will be left with 40<br>instances x (3 non-Ganak counter + 4 Ganak configurations)=280 experiments to<br>run, 10min (600 seconds) each, so that's 46h of runtime, which over 6 cores is<br>is about 8h of wall clock time. You can adjust the number of instances via<br>`--num 40` if you are willing to wait 16h, or `--tlimit 1200` if you are<br>willing to wait 1200 seconds (20min) per instance. So, e.g.<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./run.py --num 40 --tlimit 1200<br>```<br>will run 40 instances, each for 20min, thereby taking ~32h of wall clock time(!).</p>\n<p>WARNING: The process will NOT terminate its children if you start it and then<br>Ctrl-C. Instead, it will leave all the counters and shell scripts running, and<br>it will be a mess. In this case, reboot the VM, and start `./run.py` again. If you fail<br>to do this, your results will be very wrong and things will go weird.</p>\n<p>## Smoke test<br>You can run a smoke test to see if everything is working, by running:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./run.py --num 4 --tlimit 10 --threads 3<br>```<br>Then when it finishes (in a few minutes):<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./get_data_ganak.py<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --all<br>```<br>Most data will be missing, but it should nevertheless print something about<br>some problems being solved. If you run it inside the VM's graphical terminal,<br>it will also run `okular` to show the graphs. If you run it via ssh, you can<br>copy the `run.eps` file to your host, and view it. You can also run<br>`./create_graphs_ganak.py --proj`, `--unproj`, `--ganak`, etc. to get the various<br>data/graphs, although since this is a very short smoke test, it will still be<br>pretty empty of data.</p>\n<p>## Running the experiments<br>Let's run the default setup, i.e. 20+20 instances, 10min each, 6 cores, 9GB of<br>memory each. As stated, this requires 64GB of RAM and 6 cores, exposed to the VM.<br>If you don't have that, run with --threads K, where K is your memory/9GB.<br>It will then run on less cores (and hence longer), but it will run correctly.</p>\n<p>Notice that we will run 41 instances, as we will add<br>`mc2023_track3_149.cnf` to the set so that `--example` will work:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./run.py --num 20 --tlimit 600<br>```</p>\n<p>This will run for 6h. Eventually, it will finish, writing \"All done\" to<br>the console:<br>```<br>Finished waiting rank ...<br>Finished waiting rank ...<br>All done<br>```</p>\n<p>## Generating the results<br>You can examine how things went by looking into the `scratch/0`, `scratch/1`,<br>etc. directories, and checking out the corresponding `out_0`, `out_1`, etc.<br>text files. The results will be written to the `/home/vboxuser/run/out-...`<br>directories, similarly to the logs we provided.</p>\n<p>Now you can run the same scripts as before (it's symlinked here):<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./get_data_ganak.py<br>```</p>\n<p>In order to parse the logs, and create the SQLite database and CSV file. Then:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --proj<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --unproj<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --all<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --ganak<br>[.. examine output and eps ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --numbers<br>[.. examine output ..]<br>./create_graphs_ganak.py --example<br>[.. examine output ..]<br>```</p>\n<p>To get the tables and graphs, as before. The `--example` will always work,<br>as we always add the file `mc2023_track3_149.cnf` to the set.</p>\n<p>Some graphs and data will not get generated in case you have assigned<br>too little time or too few instances, and e.g. nothing actually<br>terminated, or everything ran out of memory, etc. Empty data make for<br>bad graphs.</p>\n<p># A note on version numbers<br>During the running of the experiments, we ran with two different Ganak<br>versions that differ only in how the treewidth is printed and whether<br>contraction over the independent set during graph generation is controllable<br>via the command line. The two versions are:<br>```<br>dc50a0b26a874db7c50302f48232ca2b02eebe20 -- enhanced<br>d622244b9c938bd621980e9eaa286f5766ae40d1 -- original<br>```</p>\n<p>This change does not influence the results other than what is printed when flow-cutter<br>is finished, which we never report on. You can check this via:<br>```<br>cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/<br>git diff d622244b9c938bd621980e9eaa286f5766ae40d1 dc50a0b26a874db7c50302f48232ca2b02eebe20 src/<br>```</p>\n<p>If you take a look at the version numbers in the logfiles:<br>```<br>$ cd /home/vboxuser/devel/ganak/build/data<br>$ grep revision out-ganak-also-enhanced-sat/mc2024_track2-random_194.cnf.gz.out_ganak<br>c o GANAK SHA revision d622244b9c938bd621980e9eaa286f5766ae40d1<br>c o GANAK compiled with gcc version 14.2.1 20240910c o CMS revision: 041c090adab92a47c0557edad0a0e0f5f4a6455e<br>c o Arjun SHA revision: fec6372dbbc076d455138fb32d64ebf4a2538b52<br>c o Arjun SBVA SHA revision: 5912435affe8c77ecf364093cea29e0fc5c1b5cb<br>$ grep CaDi out-ganak-also-enhanced-sat/mc2024_track2-random_194.cnf.gz.out_ganak<br>c o CaDiCaL 2.0.0 45850b35836122622a983e637251299cc16f3161<br>$ grep Vers out-ganak-also-enhanced-sat/mc2024_track2-random_194.cnf.gz.out_ganak<br>c o Version 0.2.1 d1c1a70a1be6bbc9ac606c356912a0ca70aaa2ec<br>```<br>(Note: \"Version ...\" is CadiBack)</p>\n<p>Let's run an example, to get the version numbers:<br>```<br>$ cd /home/vboxuser/devel/run<br>$ ./ganak cnfs/all/mc2023_track3_107.cnf.gz &gt; tmp # you have to be patient here, about 20s<br>$ grep revision tmp<br>c o GANAK SHA revision SOMEVERSION<br>c o GANAK compiled with gcc version 12.2.0c o CMS revision: 041c090adab92a47c0557edad0a0e0f5f4a6455e<br>c o Arjun SHA revision: fec6372dbbc076d455138fb32d64ebf4a2538b52<br>c o Arjun SBVA SHA revision: 5912435affe8c77ecf364093cea29e0fc5c1b5cb<br>$ grep CaDi tmp<br>c o CaDiCaL 2.0.0 45850b35836122622a983e637251299cc16f3161<br>$ grep Vers tmp<br>c o Version 0.2.1 d1c1a70a1be6bbc9ac606c356912a0ca70aaa2ec<br>$ rm tmp<br>```</p>\n<p>Where everything matches, except for Ganak.

You can view the complete PREreview at <a href=\"https://prereview.org/reviews/15304661\">https://prereview.org/reviews/15304661</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><i>This review is the result of a virtual, collaborative live review discussion organized and hosted by PREreview and JMIR Publications on April 10, 2025. The discussion was joined by 29 people: 3 facilitators from the PREreview Team, 1 member of the JMIR Publications team, 25 live review participants, 4 of whom joined as listeners and did not contribute to the review. The authors of this review have dedicated additional asynchronous time after the call over the course of two weeks to help compose this final report using the notes from the Live Review. We thank all participants who contributed to the discussion and made it possible for us to provide feedback on this preprint.</i></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Speech is a cornerstone of human communication, intricately connected to our cognitive, neurological, and psychological processes. Speech patterns have emerged as potential diagnostic markers for conditions with varying etiologies. This scoping review elucidates how machine learning (ML) can utilize speech patterns as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for neurological, laryngeal, and mental health etiologies. Based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria that involved a wide spectrum of conditions, ranging from voice pathologies to mental and neurological disorders, the 564 articles compiled in this investigation were condensed to 91. Methods of speech classification were then assessed between 0-10 based on the diagnostic accuracy of different ML models. High accuracies were reported for Parkinson's disease, laryngeal disorders, and dysarthria, whereas disorders like depression, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's showed promise, yet were less consistent. This review emphasizes the need for speech analysis in conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism, where graded clinical diagnoses are less robust, relative to other disorders. Key strengths of the preprint include its comprehensive coverage of disorders and the current relevance of the literature (post-2016). However, noted limitations include a lack of cross-linguistic model generalizations, a limited coverage of pediatric populations, and sociocultural variations in speech. Despite some ambiguity present in the methodologies, the paper effectively bridges the fields of speech science, AI, and clinical diagnostics. Moreover, it highlights the transformative potential of ML in developing personalized, scalable diagnostic models while also considering ethical implications, clinical acceptance, and real-world applications.</p><h2>List of major concerns and feedback</h2><p>With \"major concerns\", we refer to concerns that the reviewers believe should be prioritized in being addressed in order to ensure the soundness of the study.</p><p>Below, we summarize major concerns raised by the Live Review participants and, whenever possible, we offer suggestions on how to address them.\u00a0</p><ol><li><p>A lack of model validation. More clarity should be provided to highlight the distinction between disease state/features and symptoms. For example, neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, HD have features similar to neuropsychiatric diseases - schizophrenia, depression, etc. While the symptoms and manifestations can overlap, they are not the same thing; they differ in etiology and characteristics. The failure to delineate those characteristics weakens the study's overarching question and rationale from the start.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>A scoping review is meant to provide a wide scope of the literature to map out data, synthesize findings for interpretation, and appraisal. There is a major weakness in the findings presented in the Tables. At present, the evidence provided does not sufficiently reflect the body of empirical evidence that is available in neurodegeneration, linguistics, and ML methods to achieve the goals in the study aims/objectives. To increase the strength of the analysis and improve the data disseminated in the tables, one option could be to combine the similarities in findings in each table. This task can also improve the presentation of the data in each table.</p></li><li><p>It is not clear why the search is restricted to PubMed API and does not include other platforms such as MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (Elsevier), PsycINFO (OVID), CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Web of Science.</p></li><li><p>The methods and results should be reported in accordance with scoping review guidelines [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR), see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7326/m18-0850\">https://doi.org/10.7326/m18-0850</a></p></li><li><p>The keywords identified to search in databases should be mentioned (it could be added as a supplementary file)</p></li><li><p>The time range of the search was not mentioned</p></li><li><p>There is a lack of clarity between the neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, e.g., AD, Schizophrenia, should be distinguished since AD progresses at various stages that do not necessarily resemble the features of Schizophrenia.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Dataset size and ratio of healthy vs patients are important factors that were necessary to be mentioned in Tables 1,2, and 3.Clinical relevance</p></li><li><p>There is a need to review the profile/demographics of cohorts, groups of participants in the selected studies. This would help to demonstrate the time-course of disease/condition in their application to ML, and the nature of the pool of data extracted in the analytical phase of the study, i.e., data synthesis and interpretation. That is critical information that could be obtained in the data extraction stage (Per PRISMA Guideline). By establishing the clinical relevance here, the paper can better argue how ML methods can help clinical speech classification in neurological and psychiatric diseases for diagnostic purposes.</p></li><li><p>In the inclusion criteria, articles published in English were mentioned, but non-English articles were also included in the study. An explanation for including non-English articles was not provided by the authors. Additionally, the study deliberately focused on speech parameters, excluding the analysis of language content, which could provide a more holistic understanding of communicative aspects related to health conditions. Mentioned in 4.6</p></li><li><p>False negatives: In evaluations, speech can appear healthy even if an individual has a serious health condition, making false negatives an important consideration. Speech-based diagnostics should be an addition to other diagnostic methods, not a standalone solution. Authors mentioned this in 4.7.3. as a limitation, but no such attempt is observed in the inclusion of related literature.</p></li><li><p>The authors effectively address key issues such as patient data privacy, informed consent, GDPR compliance, and clinical deployment risks associated with AI-driven speech diagnostics. The inclusion of synthetic speech data as a means to mitigate privacy concerns is a noteworthy strength. To enhance this section, we recommend incorporating specific frameworks or strategies\u2014such as data anonymization, algorithmic transparency, and regulatory guidance\u2014to provide a more robust and actionable ethical foundation for clinical implementation. Ethical considerations, especially around AI deployment, patient data privacy, and consent, should be discussed in more detail.</p></li><li><p>The manuscript provides valuable insights, but would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of its limitations. Key areas that remain unaddressed include the lack of cross-linguistic generalizability of machine learning models, limited representation of pediatric populations, and sociocultural variations in speech, which may affect the robustness and applicability of the findings. Additionally, issues such as data scarcity, inconsistent data quality, risks of model overfitting, and potential gender bias pose challenges to the development of unbiased and reliable diagnostic tools. The generalization of findings to a broader range of mental health disorders is also a concern; while Parkinson's and schizophrenia are discussed, the exclusion of numerous other conditions limits the scope of applicability. Clarification on whether these findings can be extended to non-speech-related disorders, or a recommendation for future research in this area, would strengthen the manuscript.</p></li></ol><h2>List of minor concerns and feedback</h2><h3>Concerns with techniques/analyses</h3><ul><li><p>The manuscript does not thoroughly discuss model validation practices or the potential risk of bias, such as overfitting and limited sample diversity. Although the interpretations are generally sound, a more critical evaluation of the limitations of the individual studies could be included. The authors may wish to include a subsection that summarises the validation methods used by the reviewed studies.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>There is a lack of standardization in the techniques used across the 91 studies, as most studies employ different speech tasks, which may impact the biomarkers activated or identified. Additionally, speech impairment changes with disease progression, so it would be useful to include age and more information about the disease state.</p></li><li><p>The reference section shows inconsistencies in formatting and needs to be revised to follow a uniform citation style in accordance with a journal's guidelines.</p></li><li><p>The number of included articles is stated as 91, but Tables 1-3 present only 77 studies, while Table 4 shows 64. This discrepancy is unclear and may confuse readers. Kindly provide an explanation for the differences in the number of articles across the tables. You can include a brief footnote in the manuscript on why those articles were excluded.</p></li><li><p>In section 2.6 \"Articles Found\", it is unclear why articles including MRI, CT, EEG, Image, Wearable sensors, Video, Transcription, or Multi-modal data were excluded. Clarify the specific scope and focus of the review that justified the exclusion of these factors.</p></li><li><p>The year of publication listed in the table looks disorganised. The authors could reorder the studies in the table in either ascending or descending order of year of publication, to help readers identify the progression of research over time.</p></li><li><p>\u00a0Please clarify why GPT-4 or GPT-4.5 (instead of GPT-3.5) was not used despite being available at the time of the study.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Under \"3. Results\", the authors could use more clarifying language while describing languages used (English was the most common language, but the results also included studies on Chinese, Greek, Spanish, Malay, and Hebrew). Since non-English language studies were excluded. It looks like they may have used studies where test sets were in different languages. Suggestion: The sentence under \"3. Results\" can be restructured to clarify the same.</p></li></ul><h3>Details for the reproducibility of the study</h3><ul><li><p>The reproducibility of GRADE scoring is limited due to the absence of a clearly defined rubric or framework. Provide a detailed explanation or scoring rubric highlighting how each criterion of the GRADE scoring system was applied.</p></li><li><p>An insufficient search strategy will make it difficult for other researchers to replicate or validate the review process. Authors should expand the method section and describe the databases used, the search terms, the inclusion or exclusion criteria, and any screening processes like PRISMA flow. This will improve the credibility and reproducibility of this study.</p></li></ul><h3>Figures and tables</h3><ul><li><p>Some captions lack the specific details of the dataset used, the method languages, and the clinical settings. Also, some tables are overly dense. Revise these captions to include contexts like data sources, methodology, and clinical backgrounds. The authors may consider breaking dense tables into subcategories to enhance clarity.</p></li><li><p>The reference numbers are missing in the first column of all tables and should be added in brackets following the author names (e.g., Alan et al. [23]), to allow quick cross-referencing with the reference list.</p></li><li><p>Not all the tables were cited within the main text of the article.</p></li><li><p>The description of Figure 1 should be expanded further.\u00a0 Moreover, the authors should put the name of the primary author before the reference and the year of publication. e.g. (NAME et al. (2XXX) [114]). Figure 1 should also be revised to increase its readability. Perhaps, the authors could minimize the quadrants and increase the size of the text font.</p></li><li><p>Divide the participants' column in Tables 1-3 into \"Target Patients\" and \"Control Patients\" to improve readability.</p></li><li><p>It would be helpful if the tables listed the time duration of the studies.</p></li><li><p>There are multiple spelling mistakes and excessive use of undefined abbreviations, especially in tables. There is also a lack of standardisation in reporting speech features and methods, making comparison difficult</p></li><li><p>Could combine similar findings in each table (i.e., combine cells), but keep authors' citations in the tables.\u00a0</p></li></ul><h3>Additional comments</h3><ul><li><p>The manuscript would benefit from figures, diagrams, or charts that summarise key trends such as ML model performance across various disorders, as well as a visual overview of the review process.</p></li><li><p>There is insufficient detail on why speech disorders were chosen as the focal point in a rapidly expanding domain of ML-based diagnostics. Authors should add content and references to emphasize the broader relevance of ML in diagnostics and explain the reason behind their narrowing the scope to speech-based disorders.</p></li><li><p>Number the references in order, starting with #41.</p></li><li><p>In both the abstract and results sections, please write the abbreviation \"OCD\" as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\u00a0</p></li><li><p>In the Rationale and Results section, please revise the sentence \"ML provides enables\" by removing one of the verbs to correct the grammar.</p></li><li><p>Please add a reference to the GRADE rating.</p></li><li><p>In the Dysarthria, general section: please identify the abbreviation (PWSI-AI-AC) as patch-wise wave splitting and integrating AI system for audio classification.</p></li><li><p>In the Alzheimer's disease (AD) section, please identify the abbreviation (eGeMAPS) as the extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set.</p></li><li><p>Gomez et al. should be corrected to G\u00b4omez-Rodellar et al. in the Parkinson's Disease (PD) section and table 1.</p></li><li><p>In the Incorporating ML based speech assessment in clinical practice section, please identify (GDPR) as General Data Protection Regulation.</p></li><li><p>In the Methods section, the phrase \"focused on Parkinson, [70] focused on psychiatric disorders, and [20] focused on depression and suicide risk\" should be revised to \"focused on Parkinson, [70] on psychiatric disorders [20], and on depression and suicide risk.\"</p></li><li><p>The title includes \"state of the art\", which may be misleading as the GPT-3.5-turbo model was used in this paper,\u00a0 and since February 27, 2025, the most current version, GPT-4.5 model has been released. Authors should specify the model type in the title.</p></li><li><p>Acronyms such as CNN and AUC are used without definition on page 6.</p></li><li><p>\"3.2.6 Reinke's edemba\": It should be edema not edemba.</p></li><li><p>This manuscript requires a comprehensive proofreading and editing.</p></li></ul><p><i>We thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

        "description": "<h1>ODE-SDE gap repository</h1>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This repo contains the code implementation used to generate the results in the paper: \"Closing the ODE-SDE gap in score-based diffusion models through the Fokker-Planck equation\".</p>\n<h2>Supplied models and data</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Checkpoints for all trained models presented in the paper are given in the&nbsp;<code>checkpoints</code>&nbsp;directory. Weights of the discretised distributions associated with samples from each model are saved in the&nbsp;<code>precomputed_dists</code>&nbsp;directory. To ensure the accuracy of the numerics, this work uses a high number of epochs and large sample sizes, so these pre-supplied models are included to avoid a need to resample them. Alternativeley, scripts to train these models or generate these distributions are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>To generate the results</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The&nbsp;<code>experiment_plotting_precomputed.py</code>&nbsp;script can be used to generate the main figure in the paper using the precomputed weights supplied. This also prints all Wasserstein distances to the screen that can be used to populate the tables and supplementary figures.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To reproduce these weights using the trained models the&nbsp;<code>experiment_plotting.py</code>&nbsp;script can be used. This samples points from each model and saves the associated weights to .npy files, before plotting the corresponding results.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To make an explicit comparison for a single case, the&nbsp;<code>query_model.py</code>&nbsp;script can be used. This script allows you to specify a sample size and a model to sample from, and will return figures visualising the ODE and SDE sample distributions, as well as printing Wasserstein distances to the screen.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Moreover, if you wish to also retrain the models from scratch, the&nbsp;<code>OUPINN_loop.py</code>&nbsp;script will train and store models for all data distributions and regularisation weights. A single model can also be trained using the&nbsp;<code>OUPINN.py</code>&nbsp;script. The progress of training can be monitored through tensorboard and tensorboard logs are saved in the&nbsp;<code>summaries</code>&nbsp;directory.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For reproducing the weights or retraining the models a GPU is highly recommended. In the case of training this can take several hours.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To generate the plot of the data distributions the&nbsp;<code>data_dist_plot.py</code>&nbsp;script can be used.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">All other files (<code>data_dists.py</code>,<code>diffusion_utils.py</code>,&nbsp;<code>models.py</code>,&nbsp;<code>pinn_utils.py</code>) contain utility functions and classes used to implement the algorithms.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In line with the European Commission's Open Science policy, research publications and data should be publicly available on the internet and accessible to anyone for exploitation. Ensuring the long-term accessibility of research data is fundamental to maintaining the economic viability of the research production process. However, data availability alone is not sufficient; its quality must also be verifiable. Measures to ensure reuse and reproducibility must encompass the entire research life cycle, from experimental design and data generation to quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of results.</p>\n<p>High-quality records, particularly those providing a documented and verifiable origin of data, are essential as they serve as a certificate for potential users. These records enhance the traceability and transparency of data and processes, thereby increasing the reliability of research outcomes. Well-structured documentation, such as standard operating procedures (SOPs), plays a crucial role in establishing clear instructions designed to prevent deviations, ensuring absolute reproducibility and adherence to best practices.</p>\n<p>However, academic life science research still lacks widely agreed-upon procedures for complex routine research workflows. Implementing well-defined SOPs addresses this gap by providing a structured framework that facilitates consistency, improves data integrity, and supports regulatory compliance.</p>",

        "description": "Data Spaces are an emerging social governance model offering technical solutions for trusted data sharing while maintaining data sovereignty. Historically, data sharing has hindered business, but carbon accounting across supply chains has increased the need for automated, rapid sharing of sensitive data. Tracking Scope 3 carbon emissions is a significant driver of Data Spaces development, especially in Europe. The International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) is a leading coordinator in this field. For the past year, Eratos and the ARDC have been the only Australian members of IDSA, actively participating in Ecosystem Building Meetings and engaging with IDSA resources. Data Spaces are set to become crucial for certain industrial sectors and can enhance research collaboration. Adopting international standards from the IDSA could be the fastest way to address data sharing challenges in research. We have gained valuable insights into the IDSA's offerings and contributions, and wish to share how this organisation (and others) may support those building and managing Data Spaces to benefit their communities.",

        "description": "SCOSS, led by SPARC Europe since 2017, has the purpose of improving the sustainability of the open science / open access infrastructure which researchers have come to depend upon. Many open infrastructures were developed using project funds. Without adequate and sustained funding, they are at risk of reduced service quality, infrastructure performance, business continuity or commercialisation.  \n\nThe SCOSS model provides a trusted, community led expert governance model for the calling of proposals for funding from open infrastructures, assessment by panels of experts, crowd funding, and delivering on agreed workplans to improve sustainable outcomes.  \n\nGlobally, SCOSS has secured \u20ac5.3m from 330 pledging institutions to help sustain cross-disciplinary and globally relevant infrastructures, including the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Sherpa RoMEO (JISC), Open Citations, Public Knowledge Project (PKP), Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) &amp; Open Access Publishing Network (OAPEN), Dspace, Redalyc/AmeliCA, arXiv, Research Organization Registry (ROR), La Referencia, and Dryad.  The SCOSS infrastructure family is provided with business development support.  \n\nIn Australia and Aotearoa / New Zealand, SCOSS has partnered with Open Access Australasia and the Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) for advocacy and consortium pledging resulting in 20 institutions having pledged $300k over six years, approximately matching the ANZ pledging contribution to SCOSS to the nations' percentage of global research outputs.  \n\nResearch institutions, funders and governments in ANZ can consider the benefits of pledging to support prioritised SCOSS infrastructure. ANZ infrastructure providers with a sustainability issue may wish to submit a proposal for SCOSS crowd funding and support.",
