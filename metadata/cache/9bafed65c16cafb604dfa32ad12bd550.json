      "abstract": "<p>As noted In Chapter 1, the general class of NARMAX models is extremely broad and includes almost all of the other discrete-time model classes discussed in this book, linear and nonlinear. Because of its enormity, little can be said about the qualitative behavior of the NARMAX family in general, but it is surprising how much can be said about the behavior of some important subclasses. In particular, there are sharp qualitative distinctions between nonlinear moving average models (NMAX models) and nonlinear autoregressive models (NARX models). Since these representations are equivalent for linear models (c.f. Chapter 2), this observation highlights one important difference between linear and nonlinear discrete-time dynamic models. Consequently, this chapter focuses primarily on the structure and qualitative behavior of various subclasses of the NARMAX family, particularly the NMAX and NARX classes. More specifically, Sec. 4.1 presents a brief discussion of the general NARMAX class, defining five important subclasses that are discussed in subsequent sections: the NMAX class (Sec. 4.2), the NARX class (Sec. 4.3), the class of (structurally) additive NARMAX models (Sec. 4.4), the class of polynomial NARMAX models (Sec. 4.5), and the class of rational NARMAX models (Sec. 4.6). More complex NARMAX models are then discussed briefly in Sec. 4.7 and Sec. 4.8 concludes the chapter with a brief summary of the NARMAX class. The general class of NARMAX models was defined and discussed in a series of papers by Billings and various co-authors (Billings and Voon, 1983, 1986a; Leontartis and Billings, 1985; Zhu and Billings, 1993) and is defined by the equation . . . y(k) = F(y(k \u2013 1), . . . , y(k \u2013 p), u(k), . . . , u(k \u2013 q), e(k \u2013 1), . . . , e(k \u2013 r)) + e(k).      (4.1) . . .   Because this book is primarily concerned with the qualitative input/output behavior of these models, it will be assumed that e(k) = 0 identically as in the class of linear ARMAX models discussed in Chapter 2. </p>",

      "abstract": "<p>One of the main points of Chapter 4 is that nonlinear moving-average (NMAX) models are both inherently better-behaved and easier to analyze than more general NARMAX models. For example, it was shown in Sec. 4.2.2 that if \u0261(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) is a continuous map from Rq+1 to R1 and if ys = \u0261 (us,..., us), then uk \u2192 us implies yk \u2192 ys. Although it is not always satisfied, continuity is a relatively weak condition to impose on the map \u0261(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) . For example, Hammerstein or Wiener models based on moving average models and the hard saturation nonlinearity represent discontinuous members of the class of NMAX models. This chapter considers the analytical consequences of requiring \u0261(\u00b7) to be analytic, implying the existence of a Taylor series expansion. Although this requirement is much stronger than continuity, it often holds, and when it does, it leads to an explicit representation: Volterra models. The principal objective of this chapter is to define the class of Volterra models and discuss various important special cases and qualitative results. Most of this discussion is concerned with the class V(N,M) of finite Volterra models, which includes the class of linear finite impulse response models as a special case, along with a number of practically important nonlinear moving average model classes. In particular, the finite Volterra model class includes Hammerstein models, Wiener models, and Uryson models, along with other more general model structures. In addition, one of the results established in this chapter is that most of the bilinear models discussed in Chapter 3 may be expressed as infinite-order Volterra models. This result is somewhat analogous to the equivalence between finite-dimensional linear autoregressive models and infinite-dimensional linear moving average models discussed in Chapter 2. The bilinear model result presented here is strictly weaker, however, since there exist classes of bilinear models that do not possess Volterra series representations. Specifically, it is shown in Sec. 5.6 that completely bilinear models do not exhibit Volterra series representations. Conversely, one of the results discussed at the end of this chapter is that the class of discrete-time fading memory systems may be approximated arbitrarily well by finite Volterra models (Boyd and Chua, 1985). </p>",

      "abstract": "<p>It was emphasized in Chapter 1 that low-order, linear time-invariant models provide the foundation for much intuition about dynamic phenomena in the real world. This chapter provides a brief review of the characteristics and behavior of linear models, beginning with these simple cases and then progressing to more complex examples where this intuition no longer holds: infinite-dimensional and time-varying linear models. In continuous time, infinite-dimensional linear models arise naturally from linear partial differential equations whereas in discrete time, infinite-dimensional linear models may be used to represent a variety of \u201cslow decay\u201d effects. Time-varying linear models are also extremely flexible: In the continuous-time case, many of the ordinary differential equations defining special functions (e.g., the equations defining Bessel functions) may be viewed as time-varying linear models; in the discrete case, the gamma function arises naturally as the solution of a time-varying difference equation. Sec. 2.1 gives a brief discussion of low-order, time-invariant linear dynamic models, using second-order examples to illustrate both the \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201cless typical\u201d behavior that is possible for these models. One of the most powerful results of linear system theory is that any time-invariant linear dynamic system may be represented as either a moving average (i.e., convolution-type) model or an autoregressive one. Sec. 2.2 presents a short review of these ideas, which will serve to establish both notation and a certain amount of useful intuition for the discussion of NARMAX models presented in Chapter 4. Sec. 2.3 then briefly considers the problem of characterizing linear models, introducing four standard input sequences that are typical of those used in linear model characterization. These standard sequences are then used in subsequent chapters to illustrate differences between nonlinear model behavior and linear model behavior. Sec. 2.4 provides a brief introduction to infinite-dimensional linear systems, including both continuous-time and discrete-time examples. Sec. 2.5 provides a similar introduction to the subject of time-varying linear systems, emphasizing the flexibility of this class. Finally, Sec. 2.6 briefly considers the nature of linearity, presenting some results that may be used to define useful classes of nonlinear models. </p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter examines the extent to which models based on evolutionary economics can provide a worthy alternative to neoclassical equilibrium models. The chapter discusses the difference between Darwinian and non-Darwinian evolutionary economic models. The chapter includes a discussion of Armen Alchian\u2019s 1950 article that he says is erroneously identified as evolutionary economics. The works of evolutionary economists Ulrich Witt, Jack Vromen, Richard Nelson and Sidney are explained and critically examined. The chapter also considers the question of whether evolutionary economics can ever displace equilibrium economics. Some current evolutionary economic model builders have serious doubts. The chapter concludes with some speculations about going beyond the consideration of the individual firm to include sociological aspects of consumer preference.</p>",
