        "description": "<p>Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic development, particularly in transitioning economies. The present paper compares the entrepreneurial ecosystems of Romania and Serbia, two countries with shared historical and regional contexts but distinct developmental trajectories. Utilizing data primarily from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, this analysis examines core indicators such as perceived opportunities and systemic framework conditions. The methodology leverages GEM&rsquo;s dual approach, combining individual-level insights from the Adult Population Survey with systemic evaluations from the National Expert Survey. Additional insights are drawn from international sources such as the World Intellectual Property Organization and the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Findings reveal comparative aspects between the two ecosystems. Both Romania and Serbia exhibit relatively similar (moderate to strong) performance in - physical and services &amp; commercial and professional - infrastructure combined with moderate internal market dynamics, creating a stable foundation for basic entrepreneurial activity. Serbia stands out with relatively more robust governmental programs. Nevertheless, significant challenges persist. Romania faces pronounced difficulties in R&amp;D transfer and limited effectiveness of governmental programs, which hinder its capacity for innovation-driven entrepreneurship. Similarly, Serbia struggles with inadequate access to financing for entrepreneurs, presenting a shared obstacle to fostering a more vibrant entrepreneurial landscape. These insights bring forward shared challenges in cultivating innovation-driven entrepreneurship and highlight the inadequate institutional support. The comparative analysis underscores the importance of tailored policy interventions to address systemic weaknesses and leverage each country&rsquo;s strengths. The results also contribute to understanding entrepreneurial dynamics in Central and Eastern Europe, offering insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.</p>",

This study investigated the impact of the Knowt platform on enhancing high school students' vocabulary memorization ability. In this study, 30 high school students participated in the pilot study using the Knowt platform. Questionnaires and tests were used as the main tools to collect data for 8 weeks. After the study period, the results showed that the Knowt platform had an impact on enhancing students' English vocabulary memorization ability. Specifically, students found that the platform made their vocabulary learning process more interesting. These findings are also utilized as references for teachers and educators, devoting to the development of teaching and learning English in the 4.0 era within the new context in Vietnam.</p>",

Especially, the field of telecommunication faces complex challenges due to a number of vibrant competitive service providers. <span>Churn Examination is one of the widespread used study on analysing the behaviour and activities of customers in order to predict beforehand which customer is likely to exit the service agreement. </span>Churn prediction is very essential in telecom industries to retain their customers. According to an article in Harvard Business Review (Gallo, 2014), it was determined that the cost of acquiring a customer is five to twenty-five times more than retaining an existing one. Furthermore, by increasing retention by five percent can lead to an increase in profits by twenty-five to ninety-five percent. <span>This paper applies classification and deep learning algorithms to predict the behaviour of customer retention on a telecom dataset extracted from Kaggle. </span>Additionally, this paper also aims to build a churn prediction model and use that model to identify customers likely to churn. <span>In order to measure the performance of the model, the Area Under Curve (AUC) standard measure is adopted.</span></span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Background</strong>: Enugu state and indeed different states in Nigeria have over the years been plagued by economic challenges. The global economic recession has also contributed to this menace by exacerbating and proliferating the hardship experienced by these states. The case of Enugu State and indeed Nsukka Local Government Area has not been different. Efforts by successive administrations have done little or nothing in ameliorating the situation, hence, the need for entrepreneurship communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective: </strong>This study investigated entrepreneurship communication in economic development of Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong>&nbsp;Content analytical study was adopted through library research of secondary data as the research design for this study and the instrument of data collection included existing literatures, documents, books, journals, or other sources available in libraries. The authors used Thematic data analysis to analyse results. The study made use framing and two step flow theories as theoritical underpinning of the work.</p>\n<p><strong>Result</strong>: The study revealed that entrepreneurship communication is key to societal economic development. It also discovered that the media have key role in entrepreneurship communication advocacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The study concludes that to unlock the full potential of entrepreneurship in Nsukka, there is a pressing need for increased investment in communication-driven ventures, stronger advocacy efforts, and greater collaboration among key stakeholders. By addressing these challenges, Nsukka can create a more vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem that drives sustainable economic development.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Contribution: </strong>This study provides insights into the relationship between entrepreneurial communication and economic development in Nsukka Local Government Area. By focusing on how effective communication influences entrepreneurial success, this study provides practical insights for business owners, policy makers and development agencies by identifying barriers and opportunities for entrepreneurs, offering recommendations to foster sustainable growth in the region.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Recommendations: </strong>The local government should create enabling environment for entrepreneurship communication through her policies and programmes. For instance, ferocious campaign in form of workshops, seminars should be carried out to aid awareness creation on the need for entrepreneurial mindset and actions especially among the youth. The media should give enough reportage and coverage to entrepreneurship communication and ventures that brings about development. Also, the government should collaborate with private institutions and financial organizations to provide accessible funding for startups and small businesses in terms of grants, microfinance schemes and low-interest loans. &nbsp;In addition, the local authority should establish regular town hall meetings where opinion leaders can engage with local entrepreneurs, share business opportunities, and address challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",

        "description": "<p><span>The Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing healthcare by creating personalized, comprehensive, and dynamic digital representations of individuals. It is envisioned as a systematic, ever-growing digital and quantitative representation of actionable knowledge in human pathophysiology, encompassing data, models, and insights from diverse disciplines. The VHT will transform healthcare by improving diagnostics, enabling personalized treatment plans, and enhancing clinical decision-making.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, realizing this ambitious vision requires addressing a myriad of technical, infrastructural, ethical, legal, and social implications.</span></p>\n<p><span>This document presents a </span><strong><span>comprehensive roadmap</span></strong><span> outlining the essential elements and strategies for the successful development and implementation of the VHT. The roadmap is structured in six distinct parts, each focusing on a specific aspect crucial to the initiative's success.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part 1 establishes the </span><strong><span>rationale and context for the VHT</span></strong><span>, exploring the convergence of global healthcare needs, emerging trends, and technological advancements that drive its development. This section emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement, involving researchers, clinicians, patients, policymakers, and industry representatives in a collaborative effort to shape the VHT's vision and ensure its relevance. It delves into the key concepts of Digital Twins (DTs), highlighting their role as fundamental building blocks for the VHT.<span>&nbsp; </span>This part also provides an in-depth analysis of stakeholder needs and challenges, identifying potential barriers to the adoption of the VHT and outlining strategies to mitigate them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part 2 of the roadmap focuses on the </span><strong><span>technological foundations of the VHT</span></strong><span>, exploring how to effectively organize and integrate diverse resources, such as data, models, workflows, services and tools, to establish a robust and interoperable platform. Advanced data-generating technologies allow to capture the intricacies of human biology and (patho)physiology. DT models are at the core of the VHT, ranging from data-driven, utilizing AI, to knowledge-driven, built upon mechanistic understanding. The credibility of resources needs to be rigorously established and documented, as it provides a quantitative measure of trustworthiness and reliability for the data and models within the VHT. Integration of resources to create multi-scale and multi-organ digital twins necessitates standardized approaches to characterize and annotate models. AI tools can be leveraged to enhance data quality, accelerate resource integration, and identify gaps in the current knowledge base of the VHT.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part 3 delves into the crucial infrastructural elements required to support the development, deployment, and sustainable operation of the VHT. This part emphasizes the need for a robust and secure infrastructure capable of handling the complexities of data storage, model integration, and collaborative research within the VHT ecosystem. To realize the ambitious goals of the VHT, a trinity of interconnected software components is required: the </span><strong><span>Catalogue, the Repository, and the Platform</span></strong><span>. The Catalogue serves as the central hub for discovering and accessing VHT resources, providing detailed metadata and facilitating efficient resource retrieval. Complementing the Catalogue, the Repository provides secure and reliable storage for the vast amounts of data and models that constitute the VHT, ensuring their accessibility and preservation. The Platform, built on top of the Catalogue and Repository, offers a suite of tools and services to enable users to interact with the VHT resources, execute simulations, and analyse results. This part emphasizes the importance of adopting open standards and interoperable technologies to facilitate seamless data exchange and collaboration with other initiatives and infrastructures in the EU.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part 4 focuses on the essential </span><strong><span>ethical, legal, social, and regulatory considerations</span></strong><span> that are crucial for the responsible development and implementation of the VHT. This part emphasizes the need for a comprehensive framework that addresses the complex ethical, legal, and societal implications of this transformative technology. Establishing a robust and interoperable VHT requires the adoption of common standards for data formats, model descriptions, and terminology, to ensure data quality, facilitate data integration, and enable meaningful comparisons across studies and populations. Additionally, a robust ethical and legal framework must be established to ensure the responsible use of VHT technology and protect individual rights and privacy. This includes addressing data security, informed consent, data ownership, and the potential for bias and discrimination. Following Responsible Research and Innovation principles will be crucial in navigating these complexities, to establish trust and facilitate social acceptance of the VHT.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part 5 delves into the crucial aspects of </span><strong><span>engaging users, promoting the adoption of the VHT, and ensuring its long-term sustainability</span></strong><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This part emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach that incentivizes participation, addresses user concerns, and fosters a vibrant VHT ecosystem. It emphasizes the importance of creating a user-friendly interface, providing clear documentation, and offering training and support to facilitate user adoption. This part furthermore explores various business model strategies, including public funding, private investment, subscription models, and data licensing agreements, highlighting the importance of a phased approach that adapts to the evolving landscape of the VHT ecosystem. Establishing a VHT Marketplace is envisioned as a key facilitator for connecting VHT creators and consumers, promoting the exchange of resources, and fostering a sustainable economic model for the initiative. The roadmap also underscores the significance of integrating the VHT with existing research infrastructures and leveraging national and European funding opportunities to secure long-term sustainability.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, part 6 brings together the </span><strong><span>key findings and recommendations</span></strong><span> from the previous parts, outlining a tentative timeline of activities for the successful rollout of the VHT over the next decade. It stresses the need for a collaborative effort involving all stakeholder groups to realize the full potential of this transformative technology and integrate it effectively into the healthcare landscape. This section highlights the importance of continuous investment in research and development to advance VHT technologies, expand the knowledge base, and address emerging challenges. It also emphasizes the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure that the VHT evolves responsibly and equitably, ultimately contributing to the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The VHT roadmap provides a comprehensive framework and set of recommendations for stakeholders to effectively contribute to the development and implementation of this transformative technology. Embracing the principles outlined in this roadmap will pave the way for a future where healthcare is personalized, predictive, and participatory, leading to improved health outcomes for all.</span></p>",
