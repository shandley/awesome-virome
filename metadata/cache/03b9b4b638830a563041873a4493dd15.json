        "description": "<p><em><span>African Traditional Religion is a rich and diverse belief system that has shaped the spiritual and cultural landscape of the African continent for centuries. The profound role of faith and reason lies at the heart of this religion. Faith permeates every aspect of African traditional religion, from the belief in a Supreme Deity to the veneration of ancestors, from the performance of rituals to the practice of divination. Faith in the unseen and the divine is fundamental to African traditional religion, providing a spiritual foundation for individuals and communities. African Traditional Religion (ATR) is a vibrant tapestry of spiritual beliefs and practices that have withstood the test of time. It encompasses a wide range of rituals, customs, and deities, often interwoven with the natural world. This article will identify the intriguing relationship between faith and reason within the framework of African Traditional Religion. It will explore how these two concepts intertwine, supporting and enriching each other in the religious lives of millions across the African continent. This is done to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the rich cultural heritage that continues to shape the spiritual landscape of Africa.</span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p><em>This paper addresses the substantial connection between feminism and education, highlighting the role that feminist pedagogy plays in promoting gender equality and empowering females in the classroom. In order to establish a more inclusive and equitable learning environment, it is important to highlight the transformational potential of feminist pedagogy and its significant influence on redefining educational norms, policies, and practices. The chapter begins by describing the historical background of gender inequality in education, emphasizing the preconceptions and structural obstacles that have restricted females' access to higher education. After that, it presents feminist pedagogy as a vibrant, inclusive method of instruction that questions established conventions and gives females more agency by promoting critical thinking, engagement, and self-expression. It looks at the key concepts of feminist education, emphasizing itscapacity to foster critical consciousness, promote a diverse and inclusive curriculum, and create a safe space for dialogue and exploration of gender-related issues. It also explores the role of feminist educators in modelling equality and social justice, which serves as an essential catalyst for transformation within educational institutions. Furthermore, the chapter presents evidence of the positive outcomes of feminist pedagogy in schools, including improved academic achievement, increased self-esteem, and a greater sense of agency among girls. It also addresses the potential challenges and resistance that may arise when implementing feminist pedagogy and provides strategies for overcoming these obstacles. By challenging gender norms, empowering girls, and promoting a more inclusive learning environment, feminist pedagogy plays a vital role in shaping the future of education. It emphasizes the necessity of collaborative efforts among educators, policymakers, and advocates to foster a paradigm shift towards gender equality and create a more equitable and empowering educational experience for girls.</em></p>",

        "description": "<h2><span>Abstract:</span></h2>\n<p><span>Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, which has a multiplier effect on the economy, directly creating new jobs, and generating business for other sectors (Umesh R. Dangarwala and Krupa J. Rao, 2016). The Indian tourism industry has emerged as the most vibrant and dynamic industry in India. India, with its unique cultural and geographical diversity, offers a wide variety of tourism attractions to meet the needs of all types of tourists. Tourism is also an industry that can have several positive and negative impacts on the environment. India wins awards in various fields such as travel, cuisine, tourism marketing and offering world band travel services on air, train, road and ship. Demand for regional cuisine based on tourist health consciousness during meals, interest in regional festivals, events and environmental trends.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many tourists are also interested in the natural beauty of the environment. They try to take the nature waking trip, visit the wildlife sanctuary for the tiger lion, the visitor's park for the elephant ride. Therefore, tourism destinations not only contribute to the recognition of regional and cultural heritage but also provide a new source of income and a way to preserve the local culture. An increase in the number of tourists in India can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. The positive consequences include direct financial contributions from tourism, which can be allocated specifically to pay for the protection and management of environmentally sensitive areas, rehabilitation and maintenance efforts. The Indian government collects money through user fees and taxes on behalf of environment programs that provide the funds needed to manage natural resources. It delivers a sustainable flow of money with which local residents can protect their environment, natural resources and cultural heritage and receive economic benefits.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p><strong><span>Background:</span></strong><span> The use of building automation technology is rising as it is often adopted by sustainable design principles, offering notable opportunities for improving aspects such as energy efficiency and human comfort (e.g., daylight, temperature, air quality).</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Rationale:</span></strong><span> The integration of mechanical equipment on building envelopes such as motorized sun-shading systems introduce a series of sounds, different from traditional sources in urban environments. Buildings with higher levels of automation and moving elements can be expected to become more prevalent with the increasing densification of cities and the progress of smart technologies.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Methods:</span></strong><span> This study examines the effects of an automated shading system on the acoustic environment around a building, through a case study conducted in accordance with ISO 12913 guidelines for soundscape data collection and analysis. The methodology involves sound level measurements and binaural recordings to derive psychoacoustic indicators, as well as questionnaires to survey people</span><span>&rsquo;s perception </span><span>on-site, and a laboratory experiment with virtual reality (VR).</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Results:</span></strong><span> The soundwalks and the laboratory experiment showed that when the shading system is moving, soundscape perception typically shifts toward chaotic and annoying. These effects were only worse in combination with other sources such as a nearby kindergarten. However, when the fa&ccedil;ade is still, and without kindergarten noise, the soundscape around the building is mainly perceived as pleasant, calm, and vibrant. The acoustic analysis revealed that the shading system can increase noise levels by up to 20 dBA over the background noise at 1 meter from the fa&ccedil;ade, with levels gradually blending the background at about 25 meters from the building.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Conclusions:</span></strong><span> The results reveal that motorized shading systems in a context like this case study can significantly degrade the acoustic environment outdoors, raising sound levels beyond recommended safety thresholds, and negatively affecting people&rsquo;s perception.</span></p>",

        "description": "Research Software Development is an often underappreciated field, yet one that provides critical support for the advancement of research. Research software developers often work in small groups or individually, with limited opportunities to learn from and engage with peers. Straddling the boundary between academic and professional roles, they also face challenges with career progression and recognition.\n\nThe ARDC has established a research software agenda with one target outcome being to support research software creators to access the skills, support and recognition they need to build meaningful and fulfilling careers. QCIF proposed emulating this model within its membership cohort and with other local research organisations to help tackle some of the challenges faced by research software developers.\n\nQCIF and ARDC collaborated to host an in-person forum for research software developers from across South-East Queensland. The Queensland Research Software Developers Forum provided a platform for research software developers, scientific programmers, and research software engineers to connect and collaborate. \n\nThe event fostered a community where dispersed experts could network, share their knowledge, and exchange best practices. Over sixty people attended the one-day forum, representing nine different organisations and nearly thirty research and support groups. \n\nHalf of the participating groups delivered presentations highlighting their activities, while an unconference-style discussion session allowed participants to discuss topics of particular interest and to explore potential collaboration opportunities.\n\nThe diversity of attendees and  their enthusiasm and willingness to connect confirmed the value of working towards creating a vibrant community of research software developers in our region.",

        "description": "<p><em><span>This research paper explained a core role of consciousness and humanism in the novels of<strong> </strong>Mulk Raj Anand and especially one of his first masterpieces, &ldquo;Untouchable&rdquo;. His novels are remarkable not only for the note of humanism but also deeply related to human nature of the human being. His novels portrayed human experiences and convey a sense of life and character of human being especially in the life of worker class in the society. He has literally immersed into the flowing, vibrant core of humanity and he feels its grief to the very marrow of his bones. Being a humanist, Anand has skillfully depicted the Indian society which is hostile and callous to the lots of the low-born. His first novel Untouchable is an account of a day in the life of its protagonist- Bakha, an untouchable sweeper boy. It delineates the feelings, aspirations and problems of this sweeper boy who undergoes a lot of hardship being a low-caste within Indian society. His plight has been explored by the writer in sympathetic manner. </span></em></p>",

Diaz-Pifferrer on 29 December 1949.</p><p><b>Diagnosis.</b></p><p><i>Anolis torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> is diagnosable from all species of the <i>A. carolinensis</i> subgroup. <i>Anolis torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> was not unambiguously differentiated from <i>A. porcatus</i> in either of the uni- or multivariate analyses (Tables 1, 2; Figs 2, S 1 &ndash; S 12). Ultimately, <i>A. torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> was diagnosable from its cryptic relatives, Cuban <i>A. porcatus</i> and continental <i>A. carolinensis</i>, based on one categorical character, keelation of sublabial scales. These scales are heavily keeled in the former species and smooth in <i>A. torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> with occasional weak keelation that does not go beyond the 4 th scale (Fig. 1). <i>Anolis torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> differs from <i>A. longiceps</i> and <i>A. maynardii</i> in having a pink dewlap, yellow or pale yellow in the others. <i>Anolis allisoni</i> and <i>A. brunneus</i> have blue heads or torsos, green in <i>A. torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> <i>Anolis smaragdinus</i> has a more strongly keeled tail and is usually more homogeneous in coloration, with or without a faint mid-dorsal stripe or scapular spots. Additionally, only three members of the <i>A. carolinensis</i> subgroup occur in Cuba (<i>A. allisoni</i>, <i>A. porcatus</i>, and <i>A. torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>).</p><p><b>Description of holotype.</b></p><p>Adult male, 62.8 mm snout-vent length, 19.7 mm head length, 11.5 head width, 4 postmental scales, 5 postrostral scales, 8 supralabial scales, 6 infralabial scales, 19 loreals, 3 loreal rows, 1 interorbital scale, 4 scales between the interorbital and interparietal scales, 42 lamellae in the 4 th toe, 11 temporals, and smooth jaw scales. The color in preservative is brown overall, with dark reticulations on the neck, and narrow stripes extending from the mental scales to the throat but interrupted around the first third by two clear round markings, dark coloration in the temporal area and even darker in the side of the neck, with isolated dark scales in the first half of the body in lateral view as well as in the lower jaw. A mid-dorsal cleared stripe runs along the body, extending from the back of the head to the base of the tail (Fig. 7).</p><p><b>Variation.</b></p><p>See Table S 3: SVL ranges from 46.8 to 78.0, with a mode of 70.0. Head length ranges from 13.9 to 26.1, with a mode of 22.8. Head width ranges from 8.0 to 14.0, with a mode of 13.5. Postmentals range from 4 to 8, with a mode of 6. Postrostrals range from 4 to 7, with a mode of 5. Supralabials range from 6 to 8, with a mode of 7. Infralabials range from 6 to 8, with a mode of 6 and 7 (both occur equally). Loreals range from 19 to 30, with a mode of 21. Loreal rows range from 3 to 5, with a mode of 3. IP-IO ranges from 2 to 6, with a mode of 4. Lamellae range from 40 to 53, with a mode of 41 and 47 (both occur twice). Temporals range from 10 to 12, with a mode of 11.</p><p><b>Coloration in life.</b></p><p><i>Anolis torresfundorai</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> has a vibrant green body coloration with a whitish underside. It has a distinct thin median white stripe with paramedian dark and wider stripes running along the length of its back. The pattern is more uniform, with less ornamentation than that of <i>A. porcatus</i>. Males can have a shoulder spot. Its head features a whitish stripe that includes the labial scales and a bluish tone in the eyelids, especially the lower eyelid. As other green anoles it has two color phases, light, where the animals are green, and a dark, where they turn brown (Fig. 8).</p><p><b>Etymology.</b></p><p>The species epithet is a Latinized patronym honoring Emeritus Professor Orlando J. Torres Fundora, for a lifetime dedicated to the study and conservation of Cuban nature and the education of Cuban scientists at the University of Havana, Cuba.</p>",

        "description": "<p><b>Results</b></p><p><b>Natural history observations.</b> The specimen was observed on the eastern edge of Gunung Leuser National Park at 3&deg;32'58&quot;N, 98&deg;06'37&quot;E (Fig. 1B &ndash; 3). The observation site was situated at an elevation of 200 meters above sea level, near the park boundary, approximately 1.5 km upstream from the village of Bukit Lawang, an ecotourism hub. This observation extends the known altitudinal range for the species, which was previously documented up to 60 meters above sea level (Iskandar <i>et al.</i>, 2018). The skink was observed basking along a rainforest trail at 13:18 on 30 November 2024. A gap in the canopy allowed sunlight to reach the ground, providing suitable basking conditions. The weather was sunny at the time of the sighting, though the previous evening and night experienced heavy rainfall. The skink was approximately 50 m from the Bahorok River (Fig. 2A) and approximately 100 m from a small stream waterfall (Fig. 2B). Marco Mora (pers. comm. 2024) noted he observed &ldquo;several&hellip;on the narrow jungle paths&rdquo; in the vicinity of Bukit Lawang Village. The soil in the area is predominantly clay, covered with rainforest leaf litter, interspersed with small rocks, granite boulders, and undergrowth. The specimen was on the ground and moved approximately two meters during a three-minute observation period. It exhibited a snake-like tongue-flicking behavior with its pale, forked tongue, which we interpret as a predator evasion behavior in response to observer disturbance. When approached for close-up photography, it moved in short bursts before taking refuge in a cavity beneath a boulder.</p><p><b>Local Knowledge.</b> Discussions with local residents and guides provided some additional anecdotal information regarding the species&rsquo; occurrence in the area. Of two wildlife guides consulted, one was unfamiliar with the species, while the other referred to it as a &ldquo;butterfly lizard.&rdquo; Among five local villagers shown photographs of the skink, three had no prior knowledge of it. One local guide, who frequently traverses the trail system, reported seeing the species &ldquo;many times&rdquo; on sunny days along a trail on the opposite side of the river (Fig 3A). Another villager, a gardener living across the river from the observation site, identified a specific area in his backyard where he claimed to have seen the species (Fig. 3B). The area is open and highly disturbed with weedy vegetation interspersed amongst the granite rocks. These observations are subjective and provide supplementary context rather than rigorous evidence of the species&rsquo; distribution or habitat use, and they may offer insights on potential areas for future targeted surveys.</p><p><b>Color pattern of living specimens.</b> Male coloration and pattern (n=5 on iNaturalist; n=1 herein, Fig. 4B&ndash;E). The ground color of the top of the head is a dull reddish-brown that transitions subtly into dark gray on the dorsum, sacral region, and tail. The sides of the head from the ear opening to the nasal region are reddish-brown and bear a sharp dorsal transition&mdash;across a dark canthal stripe&mdash;with the darker dorsal surface of the head and rostrum. The upper and lower palbebral scales are whitish and notably outline the eye. Posteriorly, reddish brown on the side of the head transitions smoothly across the neck into dark gray flanks. The flanks are overlain by a series small, irregularly shaped, ventrolateral row of short elongate white markings extending from the neck through the groin and down the length of the tail. Dorsal to these, are series of small, transversely oriented, irregularly shaped dorsolateral white markings that are the lateral, unfaded remnants, of the faded semi-transversely oriented light-colored dorsal bands. The dorsolateral markings coalesce with the faded dorsal bands and continue onto the anterior two-thirds of the tail as a series of regularly spaced, dull-white, broken bands after which the tail is generally uniformly dark grey. The throat and gular region are beige and sharply transition to lemon-yellow at the back of the throat. Lemon-yellow extends across the pectoral region and belly to just anterior to the cloacal region. The yellow coloration extends dorsally up the side of the body to near the level the dorsal margin of the limb insertions on the body. All ventral surfaces are immaculate although faint oblique baring may occur in the Penang population based on our examination of the types. A short transition of lemon-yellow to orange in the cloacal region with orange extending onto the immaculate subcaudal region for at least one-half the length of the tail. Ventrolaterally, the subcaudal orange coloration abruptly contacts the dark grey dorsal coloration of the tail. The dorsal ground color of the limbs hands and feet are greyish much like that of the flanks but with a slight reddish hue. They are overlain with irregularly shaped, semi-transversely arranged, faded light-colored markings giving the limbs a somewhat banded appearance. The anterior and ventral surfaces of the forelimbs range from lemon-yellow to yellow-orange and are immaculate. The ventral surfaces of the hind limbs are orange and confluent with orange of the cloacal region. This highly partitioned coloration may provide camouflage in the leaf litter of the forest floor by disrupting the outline of the body, while the lateral lemon-yellow chest and flanks may serve as a visual signal in conspecific interactions.</p><p>Female coloration and pattern (n=1 on iNaturalist), Fig. 4A). Given that sexual dimorphism is common in many species of skinks as well as <i>Sphenomorphus</i> (e.g. Inger and Hosmer 1965; Huang 1996; Ma <i>et al.</i> 2018), we infer that the specimen in Figure 4A is likely a female based on its more muted overall coloration&mdash;a condition known for other species of <i>Sphenomorphus</i> &mdash;and what appears to be a slightly narrower head. Overall, the female is far less colorful than the males and not nearly as boldly marked although it appears to share the same distribution pattern of colors on the body. All dorsal surfaces are generally lighter and with are overall faint reddish hue that is lacking in the males. Most noticeable is a thick, dark, wavy line on each flank that extends onto the sides of the tail and is edged by the light-colored dorsolateral and ventrolateral markings described above. This wavy line appears in the descriptions by (Werner 1910) and is illustrated in de Rooij (1915:Fig. 75), although somewhat exaggerated on the flank.</p><p><b>Historical descriptions of color pattern.</b> Boulenger&rsquo;s (1890) description of the color pattern of the syntypes (one adult [SVL= 70 mm] and one juvenile [SVL= 40 mm], Fig. 5A) from Penang Island is brief: &ldquo;Brown above, with pale reddish-brown transverse bands; a black loreal streak; a series of white spots along each side; lower parts uniform white.&rdquo; That of Werner (1896) of a subadult (SVL= 60 mm [Werner 1896] or SVL= 63 mm [Werner 1910]) specimen from Sumatra (Fig. 5B) was also short. Translated from German it reads &ldquo;Above reddish-brown, with lighter brown, whitish spots and transverse bands on the sides; below dirty white. Extremities and tail yellowish.&rdquo; Obviously neither author&rsquo;s descriptions were based on living specimens. Werner&rsquo;s (1910) later (translated) redescription of the same specimen was slightly more complete: &ldquo;Upper side reddish-brown and washed-out yellowish transverse bands. A dark line from the nostril to the eye and from here, above the Tympanum extending to the base of the tail [this matches the juvenile color pattern of the Penang specimen BM BM 1946.8.2.50; Fig. 5A]; along the side of the body there is a dark reddish-brown wide and irregularly wavy band. Limbs above light spotted and banded; front edge of the forearm and under thigh, posterior edge of the thigh darkly spotted.&rdquo; Apparently de Rooij (1915) had an additional dead specimen from Nias Island, Aceh in hand, although her description seems to be combining some of the characteristics of Boulenger&rsquo;s (1890) and Werner&rsquo;s (1896, 1910) descriptions: &ldquo;Brown above, with pale reddish-brown cross bands; a blackish lateral streak, beginning at the rostral and sometimes broken up into spots on the posterior part of the body (her Fig. 75) by the light transverse bands and a series of white spots on the flanks, sometimes bordered towards the belly by an indistinct dark streak; labial sutures brownish. Lower parts white, sometimes a series of small black spots along each side of the belly.&rdquo; Grismer&rsquo;s (2011) description of the syntypes (Fig. 5A) is slightly more complete and briefly includes the juvenile pattern. It is clear that none of these authors saw living material or they would have been able to discuss the vibrant and contrasting colors.</p><p>The early morphological descriptions of the Sumatran and Penang specimens (Boulenger 1890; Werner 1896, 1910; de Rooij 1915) lack a number of important characters such as infralabial scales, chin scales in some cases and many others. Grismer (2011) provided an extensive description of the Penang specimens and that of the Indonesian specimens is in progress (Quah <i>et al.</i> in prep.) so as to facilitate direct comparisons in the context of taxonomy.</p>",
