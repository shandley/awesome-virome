    "title": "Assign 2.0: software for the analysis of Phred quality values for quality control of HLA sequencing-based typing.",
    "abstract": "As improvements to DNA sequencing technology have resulted in increasing the throughput of DNA sequencing, the bottleneck for high throughput DNA sequencing-based typing (SBT) has shifted to sequence analysis, genotyping and quality control (QC). Consistent high-quality DNA sequence is required in order to reduce manual verification and editing of sequence electropherograms. However, identifying systematic changes in quality is difficult to achieve without the aid of sophisticated sequence analysis programs dedicated to this purpose. We describe a computer software program called Assign 2.0, which integrates sequence QC analysis and genotyping in order to facilitate high-throughput SBT. Assign 2.0 performs an analysis of Phred quality values in order to produce quality scores for a sample and a sequencing run. This enables sample-to-sample and run-to-run QC monitoring and provides a mechanism for the comparison of sequence quality between various genes, various reagents and various protocols with the aim of improving the overall quality of DNA sequence data. This, in turn, will result in reducing sequence analysis as a bottleneck for high-throughput SBT.",
