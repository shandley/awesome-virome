ViralMSA wraps around existing read mapping tools such as [Minimap2](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191), and as such, it can natively improve as methods of read mapping evolve. Importantly, this approach scales linearly with the number of sequences and can be massively parallelized. However, insertions with respect to the reference genome will be thrown away. This is fair for many viral analyses (e.g. phylogenetic inference, as insertions with respect to the reference likely lack phylogenetic information), but it may not be appropriate for all contexts.\n\nTo run ViralMSA, you can either install the command-line tool (instructions below), or you can use the [ViralWasm-Epi web app](https://niema-lab.github.io/ViralWasm-Epi) created by my student, [Daniel Ji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielji26), which is a complete WebAssembly port of ViralMSA and other downstream analyses, e.g. phylogenetic inference and molecular clustering, which runs fully client-side in your own web browser. The web app works well for reasonably small datasets (e.g. a few thousand full genomes), but for larger datasets, you will want to use the command-line tool.\n\n## Installation\nViralMSA is written in Python 3 and depends on [BioPython](https://biopython.org/). You can simply download [ViralMSA.py](https://github.com/niemasd/ViralMSA/releases/latest/download/ViralMSA.py) to your machine and make it executable:\n\n```bash\nwget \"https://github.com/niemasd/ViralMSA/releases/latest/download/ViralMSA.py\"\nchmod a+x ViralMSA.py\nsudo mv ViralMSA.py /usr/local/bin/ViralMSA.py # optional step to install globally\n```\n\nIf you already have ViralMSA installed, you can update it to the newest release version easily:\n\n```bash\nViralMSA.py -u\n```\n\nViralMSA also requires at least one of the following tools to perform the alignment:\n\n* **[Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (used by default; strongly recommended)**\n* [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)\n* [BWA](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)\n* [DRAGMAP](https://github.com/Illumina/DRAGMAP)\n* [HISAT2](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2)\n* [LRA](https://github.com/ChaissonLab/LRA)\n* [mm2-fast](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/mm2-fast)\n* [NGMLR](https://github.com/philres/ngmlr)\n* [seq-align](https://github.com/noporpoise/seq-align)\n* [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)\n* [Unimap](https://github.com/lh3/unimap)\n* [wfmash](https://github.com/ekg/wfmash)\n* [Winnowmap](https://github.com/marbl/Winnowmap)\n\nWe also provide a Docker image with all dependencies installed: [niemasd/viralmsa](https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/viralmsa)\n\n## Usage\nViralMSA can be used as follows:\n\n```\nusage: ViralMSA.py [-h] -s SEQUENCES -r REFERENCE -e EMAIL -o OUTPUT [-a ALIGNER] [-t THREADS] [-l] [--omit_ref] [--viralmsa_dir VIRALMSA_DIR]\n\n  -h, --help                                  show this help message and exit\n  -s SEQUENCES, --sequences SEQUENCES         Input Sequences (FASTA format)\n  -r REFERENCE, --reference REFERENCE         Reference\n  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL                     Email Address (for Entrez)\n  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT                  Output Directory\n  -a ALIGNER, --aligner ALIGNER               Aligner (default: Minimap2)\n  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS               Number of Threads (default: max)\n  -b BUFFER_SIZE, --buffer_size BUFFER_SIZE   File Stream Buffer Size (bytes) (default: 1048576)\n  -l, --list_references                       List all reference sequences (default: False)\n  --omit_ref                                  Omit reference sequence from output alignment (default: False)\n  --viralmsa_dir VIRALMSA_DIR                 ViralMSA Cache Directory (default: ~/.viralmsa)\n  -u, --update                                Update ViralMSA (default: False)\n```\n\n## Reference Genome Selection\nViralMSA provides multiple options for selecting a reference genome against which reference-guided multiple sequence alignment will be performed.\n\n### GenBank Accession Number\nFor the reference genome, you can provide a GenBank accession number, such as the following:\n\n```\nViralMSA.py -e email@address.com -s sequences.fas -o output -r NC_045512\n```\n\n### Preselected Reference Genomes\nFor specific viruses of interest, you can simply use their name, and we have provided what we believe would be a good choice of reference genome, such as the following:\n\n```\nViralMSA.py -e email@address.com -s sequences.fas -o output -r SARS-CoV-2\n```\n\nOur preselected viral reference genomes can be found in the following GitHub repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/Niema-Lab/Reference-Genomes\n\nIf you would like to contribute a new or updated viral reference genome to our collection, please feel free to submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Niema-Lab/Reference-Genomes/issues/new) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Niema-Lab/Reference-Genomes/pulls) with all relevant information.\n\n### Local File\nIf you have a local reference genome you would like to use, you can provide the path to a FASTA file with a single sequence, such as the following:\n\n```\nViralMSA.py -e email@address.com -s sequences.fas -o output -r my_reference.fas\n```\n\n## Citing ViralMSA\nIf you use ViralMSA in your work, please cite:\n\n> Moshiri N (2021). \"ViralMSA: Massively scalable reference-guided multiple sequence alignment of viral genomes.\" *Bioinformatics*. 37(5):714\u2013716.

This issue should be fixed in [ViralMSA 1.1.12](https://github.com/niemasd/ViralMSA/releases/tag/1.1.12), but if you run into this issue, a simple fix that seems to work well is to simply shorten the streches of `N`s in the sequence to be at most ~100 before running ViralMSA.\n\n## Missing letters from the beginning/end of some sequences\nIf you notice that some sequences are missing letters at the beginning/end, even though they don't appear as insertions with respect to the reference genome, it could be that the read mapper (e.g. Minimap2) is soft-clipping those bases from the alignment (if you open the `.sam` file in the output folder, those entries should have soft-clipping, denoted by `S`, at the beginning/end of the CIGAR string). A simple hacky fix is to add a bunch of matching letters (e.g. `AAAAA...`) to the beginnings/ends of all of your sequences (including your reference genome) to force a match at the beginning/end of the pairwise alignment done by the read mapper, thus preventing soft-clipping.\n\n## Missing Sequences in Output\nBecause ViralMSA relies on read mappers to compute each pairwise alignment to the reference genome, and because read mappers can fail to align a sequence if it deviates too significantly from the reference genome, sequences from your input can be omitted from ViralMSA's output if they did not appear in the output of the underlying read mapper you used, and you'll be shown the following warning:\n\n> WARNING: Some sequences from the input are missing from the output. Perhaps try a different aligner or reference genome?\n\nAs is mentioned in the warning, to remedy this, you can either try a different reference genome (if you believe there is one that be more similar to *all* of your sequences than the reference you're currently using), or you can try a different aligner (using the `-a` argument). I will briefly mention that there is typically a trade-off between accuracy/sensitivity and speed for different read mappers, so feel free to review the literature to compare/contrast the different read mappers supported by ViralMSA.\n\nAs a last resort, ViralMSA also supports [seq-align](https://github.com/noporpoise/seq-align), which performs complete pairwise global alignments. This method is the most sensitive (it's guaranteed to align every sequence in your input), but it will likely be ***much*** slower than the other options. To use it, you can specify `-a seq-align`.\n"
