  "data": "# Predicting bacteriophage hosts based on sequences of annotated receptor-binding proteins\nThis repository contains the code and database related to our manuscript \"Predicting bacteriophage hosts based on sequences of annotated receptor-binding proteins\", published in Scientific Reports (January 2021). This research is funded by a PhD fellowship strategic basic research from the Research Foundation \u2013 Flanders (FWO), grant number 1S69520N. \n\nAccess the research paper via the following link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81063-4\n\nMore specifically, this repository contains the following files:\n* <i>RBP_database.csv</i> contains the collected RBP sequences as described in Materials & Methods.\n\n* <i>RBP_functions.py</i> is a Python script containing all the necessary manually implemented functions for the various analyses carried out in this study.\n\n* <i>RBP_alignment.jl</i> is a Julia script used to compute pairwise alignments between the sequences to explore the diversity and assess redundancy in the database.\n\n* <i>RBP_alignmentscores.txt</i> is .txt file containing the alignment scores if you prefer not to compute them with the provided Julia script.\n\n* <i>RBP_host_prediction.ipynb</i> is an IPython notebook containing all the analyses, model constructions and evaluations described in Materials & Methods.\n\nImportant notice: the code in this repository is provided as is and is no longer under active maintenance. Thank you for understanding.\n"
