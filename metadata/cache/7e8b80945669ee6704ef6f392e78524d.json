        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Science, art, and spirituality&mdash;often seen as distinct&mdash;are, in truth, three lenses to explore a single reality: Who are we, and what is our place in this cosmos? This paper presents a practical and philosophical journey that interweaves these realms through the creation of a sustainable, low-cost scientific toy. Developed initially as the End Semester Project of a Choice Based Course &lsquo;Designing Scientific Toys&rsquo; at Navrachana University. It was born from the author&rsquo;s own lived experience as an Artist, Engineer, Educator, Seeker, a Lifelong Learner, and a B.Ed Student. Then it evolved to the current 2nd version with Mentor's Vision, guidance, and author's hard work. The author also as someone who has personally battled the depths of depression and survivor of dark suicidal phase is on a mission to save students from suicides. The inclusion of suicide prevention and mental well-being is not an academic formality, but a life-and-death necessity.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">This is not a definitive claim, but a perspective&mdash;a reflection of insights </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">gathered while building, teaching, meditating, and living. As the Tao of Physics beautifully reminds us, &ldquo;Modern physics has come to take a radical turn toward mysticism when it enters the atomic and subatomic domain&rdquo; (Capra, 1975). Just as quantum theory reshaped the boundaries of logic, so too must education transcend rote learning to become an integrated experience of head, hand, and heart.</span></p>\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.fm1bg4s58xog\"></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">The toy integrates scientific principles such as the cam-shaft-follower mechanism, Newton&rsquo;s laws, torque, and energy transfer, hinge-based motion, moir&eacute; interference patterns, and surface tension through bubble formation. At a deeper level, it opens doors to questions of consciousness&mdash;symbolized by the pineal gland and the third eye, rooted in both neuroscience and Vedic symbolism.</span></p>\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.9iad2sobklr3\"></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">The learning design follows a constructivist path, incorporating Piaget&rsquo;s theory of cognitive development, Skinner&rsquo;s reinforcement theory, Thorndike&rsquo;s law of effect, and the 8 Learning Events Model by Leclerq and Poumay. These are mapped onto Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy to move beyond memorization towards application, analysis, evaluation, and creation. The toy-building activity uses discarded and recycled materials&mdash;pen refills, gift boxes, cardboard, bottle caps&mdash;echoing the principles of SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The spiritual dimension unfolds through themes of Karma (action and consequence), Maya (illusion), impermanence, and unity of Shiva-Shakti (balance of cosmic energies). These are not religious abstractions but psychological truths. As <strong>Carl Jung wrote, &ldquo;Who looks outside, dreams, who looks inside, awakens.&rdquo;</strong> Students are invited to explore these layers through reflection questions, journaling, and dialogue&mdash;linking the mind&rsquo;s mechanisms with the mechanics of motion.</span></p>\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.ik34lnymaacu\"></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">By weaving together scientific thinking, spiritual depth, and artistic expression, this project transforms learning from a task into a personal journey. It invites students not merely to memorize formulas but to create, question, and contemplate. Through hands-on engagement and reflective practice, learners begin to see science as alive, art as purposeful, and spirituality as a lived experience&mdash;not an abstract ideal. The use of recycled everyday materials does not just reduce environmental impact; it nurtures values like mindfulness, resourcefulness, and harmony with nature. Ultimately, this approach helps create a learning environment where knowledge is not just acquired but lived. <strong>Aligning with the vision of the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals: &ldquo;peace and prosperity for people and the planet.&rdquo; It lays the foundation for a future that is not only sustainable, but also compassionate, creative, and deeply aware.</strong></span></p>",

        "description": "<p><em><span>The Vaishnava philosophy have outlined the paths through which individuals can discipline themselves to attain the divine. These principles are categorised into two main divisions. They are Bhakti (devotion) and Prapatti (surrender). It encompasses five distinct paths. These include Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action), Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), Prapatti Yoga (the path of surrender), and Acharya Abhimana (reverence for the spiritual teacher). They are designed to guide the soul towards complete submission to the divine. The Vaishnava doctrines elaborate that Karma Yoga, when matured, evolves into Jnana Yoga, and Jnana Yoga, in turn, culminates in Bhakti Yoga. These paths ultimately lead the seeker to Saranagati (total surrender), the final stage of spiritual realisation. Vaishnava literature, through its hymns and devotional verses, imparts these very teachings to humanity, emphasising the profound connection between the soul and the divine. The objective of this research article is to explore the philosophical tenets of Vaishnavism and their in-depth interpretations as conveyed through the sacred compositions of Vaishnava saints. Their pasurams (devotional hymns) and songs serve as a medium to unravel the essence of Vaishnava thought, offering insights into its spiritual and theological depths. By examining these literary works, the study aims to illuminate the transformative journey of the soul towards divine union, as prescribed by Vaishnava tradition. In essence, Vaishnava philosophy delineates the pathways to spiritual liberation and eternal communion with the divine.</span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p>This paper presents one of the most detailed and linguistically grounded attempts to decode the\u202fPhaistos Disc &mdash; one of the greatest and most mysterious puzzles of the ancient world. Leveraging comparative phonetics, Minoan archaeological context, and symbolic correlations with\u202fLinear A, this study proposes a coherent linguistic translation, reconstructing the disc as a sacred hymn or ritual blessing.</p>\n<p>While the Phaistos Disc has long remained officially undeciphered due to its unique symbols, limited corpus, and lack of direct textual parallels, this work breaks important ground by:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key Contributions:</p>\n<p>Phonetic Reconstruction:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Uses visual-symbolic correspondences with\u202fLinear A and hypothesized Indo-European roots to generate approximate phonetic values.</p>\n<p>Provides transliteration of key symbol groupings with contextual reasoning for each sound assignment.</p>\n<p>Semantically Coherent Translation:</p>\n<p>The inscription is proposed to be a formal blessing or hymnal invocation to deities, using a repeated phrase structure that strongly suggests ritual prose or chant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key translated segment:\u202f&ldquo;A NI MU PA&rdquo;\u202fis interpreted as \"To the gods &mdash; a flowing gift.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextual Linguistic Links:</p>\n<p>Draws on similarities with pre-Greek Minoan linguistic patterns and known religious lexicons from contemporaneous Mediterranean societies.</p>\n<p>Discusses the implications of these parallels for understanding Minoan spiritual practice and language structure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Archaeological Framing:</p>\n<p>Situates the disc within its Cretan Bronze Age context, including references to nearby artifacts (e.g., the Arkalochori axe) to support symbolic continuity.</p>\n<p>Contends that the disk is not an isolated curiosity but part of a broader Minoan communicative or ceremonial tradition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Importance of this Work:</p>\n<p>Provides one of the first fully coherent translations that fits both symbol frequency analysis and ritual syntax.</p>\n<p>Opens a serious new direction in the study of Minoan proto-writing and religious language.</p>\n<p>Offers a legitimate alternative to mainstream scholarly skepticism without lapsing into pseudoscience.</p>\n<p>For Scholars, Historians, and the Curious:</p>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a linguist, archaeologist, or simply a seeker of historical truth, this paper invites a fresh look at one of the ancient world&rsquo;s most enigmatic artifacts. It is not presented as the final word &mdash; but as a compelling, research-based contribution to a discussion long dominated by impasses.</p>",

It is emphasized that, first of all, this process is hampered by the insufficient use of new information technologies available on modern vessels; the lack of exercises for solving production tasks; the insufficient isolation of the main didactic technological units of practice; the unsatisfactory state of methodological support of the practical training system. During the study, a model of the formation of practical skills of future specialists in the process of technological practice was developed, which has the properties of a dynamic integrated process and affects the results of practice.</span></p>",

</span>S: How would you define migrant irregularity </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: So migrant irregularity is is defined in law and the emphasis is to to sort of irregularity: </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&nbsp;</span>the overstayers those who entered Portugal legally with the short term visa or with the visa exemption regime and overstay it irregularly </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">and those who enter the border the Portuguese border irregularly: so without the visa or without any exemption regime </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To my relief most of irregular migrants in Portugal are overstayers not people who enter illegally</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: So they enter legally and then they overstay? </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: yes</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> <strong>So what type of data sources do people use to determine or measure migrant irregularity</strong>? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> fortunately is it's easy because we have a permanent regularisation regime, it does not exist in other countries, and if you see the <u>the amount of of residence permit issues on those legal bases</u> you see the <u>most of of migrants they they apply for regularization</u> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: So you count the people that apply to the regularisation program? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">C</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">: Yeah because if they enter in the country legally they will not<span>&nbsp; </span>apply for those; for those others, they have another another legal channel. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Then if you if you sort by in the statistics<u> by the legal basis of the residence permit</u> you can easily count <u>how many people regularize their situation their migratory situation.</u> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> <strong>So reflecting on your personal experience could you share some positive and negative examples of dealing with migrant irregularity?</strong> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> in<span>&nbsp; </span>Portugal the law since uh since 2007 and after that most after the changes in the law in 2017 and 2018 has inshrined<u> the permanent regularization regime </u>so <em>most of the peopl</em>e who apply because they are inserted into the in <u>the labor market</u> or they <u>they they are studying</u> in Portugal or <u>they have family members in Portugal</u> they they apply for those residence permits and if you see the numbers of apply at the applications and the very <strong><u>very low rate of rejection</u></strong> you can you can imagine that <u>permanent regularization system to avoid that people are people living in Portugal in the in the irregular migrant situation </u></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> so the the next question it would be how is your organization involved you don't represent one right now well maybe I don't know if you're comfortable with answering how were you involved with&hellip;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> yeah I was involved <u>2017 and 2018 changes of the law to ease the pathway to to the legal status</u> status for those who are living in Portugal who are working in Portugal but they don't have a residence status,<span>&nbsp; </span><span>so the changes in law were enacted to to ease this pathway to allow people to to regularize their migratory status</span> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">um so yeah so why would it be why is it prevalent this migrant irregularity in Portugal if it is if you think that it is </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">I think that the the <u>the old system of migratory rules</u> that expect that people are coming from the origin country <u>already legal</u> are <u>a little bit out of reality</u> yes and because of that and they are also combined with the <u>very bureaucratic procedures that sometimes are not fit to the to the human mobility or </u>even the<u> needs for labour force in Portugal</u> and so on.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">For instance we have many many students, third country national students that are applying for our universities and when they are accepted I don't know maybe in august or something like that the school school year begins OK in September and <u>they should come with the with the residencies</u> for study purposes BUT that's <u>it is so so complicated to get this visa</u> yeah <u>most of these people have even the right to have this visa</u> if they are enrolled in university <u>they have means of subsistence</u> <u>they don't have any criminal records</u><strong><em> so they have a right to get this visa</em></strong> <em>but</em> sometimes <u>t</u>hey only have an appointment I don't know in December so they don&acute;t wait for the december,<span>&nbsp; </span>otherwise they lose one semester,<span>&nbsp; </span>so they come. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">For example, if they are Brazilian for instances, they come without a visa because they are exempted of visas for entering and short stays </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or others come, I don't know a tourist type visa </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">And then, afterwards, once in Portugal they regularize their situation. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So<u> I think our consulates are not are not in shape to to process quickly those visa applications</u> uh and so <u>people don't wait</u> so </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: yeah the law is there but the pa&hellip;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: the practice yeah so <u>those people mostly they enter legally</u> because they enter enter and then once in Portugal <u>they apply for the residence permit and almost 100% of of probability of getting one</u></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br><br><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> (OK good oh so yeah so you know we just were talking about the next question that I was going to)so we talked about the pathways which people come out so they enter maybe irregularly because of this long wait to get a visa but they had for example for school but this question is also about)<u> what are the pathways through which people fall into and come out of irregularity in Portugal?</u></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: Our law is very generous &ndash; we have plenty of paths regularize the situation so the law is not strict in the sense that people have to come legally from the country of origin; for almost every disposition of the law you have a rule and you have an exception and the exception is always the most applicable yeah yeah it is like that in Portugal</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">so yeah so following that question <u>what would be the the reasons that migrants remain in the irregularity even though there are these legal instruments in place</u> so for example here they give a few examples if you think that this applies or not for example regularization status change crime prevention deportation work or C: I didn't understand your your question </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> so this would be why why is there still a migrants that are irregular<span>&nbsp; </span>even though there are these laws and these procedures?</span></p>\n<p><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:</span></u></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Of course you have all of this percentage of people that does not fulfil the requirements: </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">for instances if someone has a<u> criminal record in the country of origin</u> there is no way to ask to apply for residence permit; </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">If someone has no means of subsistence because they don&acute;t work, doesn't study doesn't so</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">And those that remain in the country they have to remain irregular</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">So what do you think that are the direct and indirect policies and policy measures that relate to migrant irregularity in Portugal? [this is under module 2 policy and impact] </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: I don't think that is the prevalence of migrant irregularity in Portugal I don't think so</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">[S: [rephrasing] this isn't asking if there is, this is asking what are the direct and indirect policies that there is in Portugal that relate that to migrant irregularity, so if they have a a positive or a negative impact, they are just related to it ]</span></p>\n<p><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:</span></u></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> I think the of course the the <u>the flexible law on regularization</u> is is a perfector for sure many people choose Portugal even they come from other countries in the EU because they they see a chance of getting papers yes and and residence permits so uh so I I think I think <u>the policy in Portugal was real towards the integration of all migrants</u> giving them a chance to regularise. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Even through COVID s we were almost countries in the world followed this policy to to get <strong><u>the general regularization to allow all people you irrespective of their legal status</u></strong> doesn't leave them to to get access<u> for instance to health service</u>s and things like that we <strong><u><span>the Portuguese migration policy is not led by securitization</span></u></strong><span> otherwise we didn't intend so many<span>&nbsp; </span>pathways to allow people to regularize their their status.</span> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> yes so our next question would be how is policy development in the area of migrant irregularity if influenced by a available available data on irregular migration? </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: as per per destination you cannot have you don&acute;t have a registry of irregular migrants so you can have regular migrants but but <strong><u>we can we can estimate the stock of migrants</u></strong> <u>through the applications for regularization</u> and and<u> then you can see if if we have more or less migrants choosing our country</u> to regularize their status; as I have said most migrants that have t<u>hey have legal status today they were overstayers in the past</u> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: yes so so in this case towards this question it would be the the the these estimates if there is a if we can see that there is a lot of or like a a new wave of irregulars it would impact policy development to try and make new mechanisms to regulate or something like that?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">C</span></u></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">: yeah we are trying to because because most of people we have this consciousness that that <u>many migrants were overstayers</u> we are trying to&hellip;: </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&nbsp;</span>for instance government made agreements with the Morocco and India to to enable people that are seeking work or labour in Portugal to <u>to apply and come legally from the beginning</u> and I don't know I don't have data to see if those agreements those bilateral agreements they have the positive impact or not to reduce irregularity</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&nbsp;</span>or for instance the new measures since 2021 or.. no, 22, t<u>he visa for for for those who don't who doesn't have who don't have any work </u>yeah yes to church work in Portugal </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: so sorry I couldn't get that </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: So the long term visa for job seekers, this was also a measure to reduce irregularity. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: Yes because with this they they no longer have to have the contract before </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: exactly they have to have a clean criminal record yes and they can enter Portugal and doing some months until six months </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: OK and this they would get this through the consulate in their country?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: Yes, in their in their country. <span>Again, the problem is that Portugal is not a big country and our<span>&nbsp; </span>consulate network is a little one</span> so you don't have a consulate in Nepal and other countries but you know<span>&nbsp; </span>that the community Nepalese or bangladeshi they're growing the community</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: how would that work?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: yeah they have to go to another country, they have to go to India, for instances, and from there and from there, that is out of reality if they need to go to Nova Delhi for instance they come directly to Portugal </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S:yeah and of course and the expenses and everything s</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: and they come in a Schengen tourist visa, the cost and the time that they would spend to come and get such a visa you can directly come to Portugal, it's not realistic</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">The next question would be what factors or events have influenced or significantly impacted policy development in the field of irregular migration in Portugal in recent years? so because this study is from 2010 up at 2010 </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: so OK we don't have as I say Portugal we don't we don't know this phenomena of irregular entering the country; we don&acute;t have this influx from the Meditteranean sea or something like that; so we are not in this migratory routes so yes so we are not inserted in these migratory routes so as I said most of our irregular migrants they are overstayers </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: so So there's not a specific event or like the Mediterranean routes</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: yeah because you don't we don't have this phenomenon yeah spread lacking Greece Italy and Spain yes I cannot&hellip; I but our authorities they they are always very concerned about integration of migrants and because of that we have those those legal mechanisms to to to regularize people because otherwise this is the first requirement for an integration people that don't have migratory regular status you cannot integrate in society this is the first yes pre requirement for successful integration </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">relating to this it would be how have or if it has happened how have external policies so policies approaches of neighbouring countries or relevant regions regions like the EU have influenced policy development in Portugal?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:<span>&nbsp; </span>so as I as I say we we we don't have this problem yeah that lets some member states to outsource their policies yeah we have another view on on external relations to improve legal channels because of that<u> Portugal in 2015 proposes and there's the the CPLP</u> and the agreement of mobility between member states have the community of Portuguese speaking countries so in Africa East Timor, Brazil,<span>&nbsp; </span>that are now in force and this is an agreement that that <u>offers in both directions very open and easy legal channels for nationals of those countrie</u>s, so those people they don&acute;y need to come irregularly, it&acute;s another step that allows for mobility between our countries </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: so just a question..</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: we use our bilateral relations not to tackle irregular migration</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: to prevent it? </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:<span>&nbsp; </span>yeah to prevent itthrough legal pathways OK yeah so we closed the agreement with India with with with Marroco and also with all that inside the CPLP so we can tell those agreements or do you have to to prevent migrants but we have agreements to improve legal channels reduction </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> exactly so that would be because the next one question is which policy measures enacted have had a clear impact on reducing migrant irregularity in Portugal and how? So<span>&nbsp; </span>it would </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:it would be that exactly enhancing legal path </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: exactly it's not to prevent them from coming it's just to prevent them from coming irregularly </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: exactly and for that we create legal pathways the prevention of irregular migration, not through securitization but through improvement of legal tests pathways and this is clear since 2015 the policy of the country </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">yes yeah so yes as you said you don't really the the data is the measuring but the next question is what kind of data is used for determining policy impact and what what kind of data is produced through policy evaluations so this is to see how do people all do does the government and the institutions know if that policy is actually working or not </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: yeah oh I'd like to I I don't have this data but you can you can have some some indirect data; so t<u>he integration of migrants into the the labor and in the official labor market</u> that that for that you need to have a residence so we will have to regularize and <u>has a positive impact</u> in our for instance in our Social Security system and if you see <u>the data of the contributions migrants</u> millions this Social Security system you can easily see the positive and this is the figure yes so you can imagine without without regularization you could not have those contributions<span>&nbsp; </span>but but maybe those people were in the black markets and Social Security right and so on and so on so I think <strong><u>Social Security data </u></strong>are are really a<strong><u> very good indicator of the impact of those top policie</u></strong>s </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">so yeah so our next question would be what occupational sectors or geographic areas in Portugal are the most relevant for addressing migrant irregularity through targeted policy measures and why definitely</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:<span>&nbsp; </span>we definitely have all those those low low income branches like <u>agriculture services</u> in <u>the tourist area </u>so the <u>civil construction</u> too even <u>fisheries</u> should say those branches there they they they are really critical because first of all they they have a <u>huge demand of manpower labor force</u> that those industries<span>&nbsp; </span>cannot supply they don't they cannot accommodate without migration yes it's impossible and even even <u>even with our migration flow</u> that is growing every year and Even so you have huge huge labour forces demands on those sectors so have to real vigilant of those sectors because they are also those sectors that can absorb the irregular migration </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">could you maybe I don't know if you if you have any data on this but any occupational or sector specific policy measures to prevent a pathway into or path or provide a path pathway out of so these these would be the ones that are specific for example to agriculture if there </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: there is not no no no no specific no specific policy because because our legal migration policy is is designed for but general for general OK and even but and you see these almost two to protect migraines because of that for instance it does nothing which sector all migrants that are under abusive labor conditions they can apply for residence permits if they denounce their labour,<span>&nbsp; </span>article 122 of the migration law allows for regularisation of those migrants we have those dispositions since 2007 oh when the original law was was created yes to protect those migrants that are are more vulnerable </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: so here sorry just if I understood correctly here it's if they are irregular migrants and they are working in abusive conditions if they denounce it </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: they can apply for the residence laws and they are treated like victims of trafficking OK OK I have they have also same the same the same rational OK I I didn't know that yeah and this is a disposition in our law since 2007 so migrants that are under I have been received the labor conditions they don't need to have fear to denounce it to the authorities of course if they are treated of course because if they they did not ask this situation and they are under everything they have and then article 122 they they can they become they can have the residence permit and with the residence permit they can work yes OK, this is important to tackle one take one of off the pool <strong><u>the black market </u></strong>in level yes yes yes if you tack on the black market the labor black black market you can also reduce the the people there the fear to yes </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: it's very important because um yeah so because one of the questions that I that I do have is because maybe people don't they they these policies are in place and they are people they fear that if they try to apply to regularization they would be deported so there is but there are these mechanisms that protect them </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:if you see the the reports on on on regularization of of of migrants and you see that in Portugal it's not 88 nr2 the number two this is the regularization maybe the most of the people are regularizing their situation situation through this &ldquo;manifesta&ccedil;&atilde;o de interesse&rdquo; and if they apply they don't they don't get deported yeah of course so otherwise you cannot test so many<span>&nbsp; </span>statistics of people in Portugal with the residence permit yeah it's right here its skyrocking since 2016 so yes</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> yes after the crisis calmed down we started seeing the and now it's more than ever so yeah so this would be the cause the next question is are there specific examples of promising pack practices that facilitate pathways out of irregularity or prevent pathways into so these these would be the the path ways </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: These are the pathways, and the others are the<span>&nbsp; </span>job seeker visa and those agreements with India and Morocco on legal migration; those agreements with CPLP on legal migration we don&acute;t have any words on preventing irregular migration they are agreements to set up legal pathways for people who want to live in Portugal so so this is for I think <u>the best way to reduce the irregular migration</u> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">yeah so these are what would be the the the prevailing policy challenges in Portugal that relates to migrant irregularity </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: t&acute;s to open legal pathways to prevent irregular migration</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: sorry so so it it would be to get more legal pathways?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: Of course it&acute;s to ease and to open legal pathways for migrants so they don't need to to stay irregular in our country </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: do do you have any opinions on how these should be addressed or how these challenges should be addressed and these these legal pathways that you mentioned </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: are in my opinion open legal pathways are in my opinion the best way to address it </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: no no no I do I do get it but but legal pathways can be many things give the people the check to have there the regular OK this chance OK OK not to close it to give everyone a chance OK chance to to to have OK OK status regular because if you don't have those chances those pathways of course you can you will come down many many people to to irregularity of course but we could see any possibility to regularise the situation people will be and the pinot expel everybody of course civil of course you cannot have return policy that is so another percent effective that every single illegal or irregular migrant and also you don&acute;t have the means that so you condemn people to irregular status without all the negative consequences of that; if you are irregular you of course lack in many social rights, economic rights you are you you are always in clandestinity, vulnerable to abuses, etcetera etcetera; yeah so so the best way to deal with this drama chance papers of course </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: because because my question I don't know maybe I'm not interpreting this right because so because some could argue that there are in Portugal at least like talking about Portugal there are technically the legal pathways for people to to so </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: this would be yeah of course you have problems into the law application because our services are not feet to deal with these huge numbers so if you see if you if you see for instance SEF is not the service that is growing we're OK now it will be extinguished; but if you see the number of of of staff that SEF has during all those years and the number of applications that the same staff has to deal with yes In the last eight years yeah so you have the same amount of people that for right now in 2007 deal with three hundred thousand people and now you have the same people but we have yeah yes so you have of course to to readapt those services to the demand </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: OK so that that that would be my question </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C:yes if you want to have an appointment in SEF OK you can apply online with the &lsquo;Manifesta&ccedil;&atilde;o de interesse&rsquo; online but to to to to have the concretization of this into a real residence permit it takes quite a long time<span>&nbsp; </span>but ask for for the the the data SEF of<span>&nbsp; </span>they can give you the data yes how many demands theu have per year how many rejections and how many positive decisions, OK they came very late, but they do come, yes but you can see it and you can maybe that only real a very very small percentage I don't know I remember I don't I don't have the exact numberbut but I remember for some three or four years just percentage of rejection was check 1% oh gosh yeah 0.5 or 0.4 yeah OK every 100 applications most of them were positive and change of this procedure OK t<span>he procedure takes a long time because the they have the same staff for there's no resources</span> yeah that wave of applications yeah so they should be readjusted to more stuff yeah of course but now we'll see how these new changes would would go yeah so yeah </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">so these are the last few questions the this one would be what themes relating to migrant irregularity are among the top priority for Portugal in the next few years what do you think </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: again Portugal doesn't have the irregular influxes, so we don&acute;t see people trying to enter Portugal through this sea or I don't know what yeah you don't have this this drama yes yes this daily drama that some other countries have uh so and overstays you don't you don't see them they are unseable, eah yes OK and they don't enter the country under they're not think conditions they enter the country mostly by plain mostly regular without any drama associated so I think the the the next <u>the most challenging part</u> of this is to to to <u>to have even more legal channels from the origin</u> even to avoid even overstays that but for that<u> you need to readdress our consular network</u> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S:OK because that's exactly the next question it would be how could you address it so readdress </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: <u>readdress the consular network</u> <u>readdress the match mechanisms between offer and demand </u>yes so to to enable first <u>enterprises Portuguese enterprises to offer jobs they really have</u> and to make the match with the demands of of I don't know whatever people are in the world that's fitting into this charge and I will and this is the mending OK to have a better match between offer and demand to have a better functioning counselor councillor network yeah </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">so our last question would be what kind of data would be needed to to support policy development in in this area </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: you have you have to you like to data what kind of education estimate more or less the irregularity what do you think it's useful in the to in this area what kind of data yeah what kind of data should be in I <em>don't see for instance that is useful to register entries and exist</em> you don't see okay entries and exit like the entry exit down over stairs because you can have this this data through estimations yeah without the need to spend millions in in solar system so you could could could you could have this those estimations and even the data on return they can give you an estimation</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">S: How so?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: because if you see the data that the european commission on eurostat is collecting on return decisions for irregular migration page OK so you don't have huge numbers because you don't have such an amount of irregularity that you you think that you have alright you don't have to search huge numbers because you don't have yeah so problem with irregularity OK so I don't know maybe those states good anyway status dictate that exists on on return you called to have more estimation of your </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Q &rarr;<span>&nbsp; </span>S:</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> OK OK perfect so last question is if you have any other relevant information that should be shared or that you think that it's relevant for this type of research no OK perfect let me just stop oh </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">C: no </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br>THE END</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Background: Pranayama has been described in detail in Hatha yogic texts. In this study, eight texts of<br>Hatha Yoga (Hatha Yoga Pradeepika, Gherand Samhita, Shiva Samhita, Gorakshapaddhati, Yoga Beej,<br>Vashishtha Samhita, Hathratnavali, Siddhasiddhanta Paddhati) have been taken. Eight Kumbhakas<br>have been described in Hatha Yoga Pradeepika. Eight types of Pranayama have been described in<br>Gherand Samhita. Nadi Shodhan Pranayama is described in Shiva Samhita. Nadi Shodhan Pranayama<br>is also described in Goraksha Paddhati. Two types of Kumbhakas i.e. Pranayama have been described<br>in Yoga Beej, whereas Vashishtha Samhita has described Pranayama as containing Omkar and divided<br>it into three stages. Nine types of Pranayama have been described in Hathratnavali and in<br>Siddhasiddhanta Paddhati, stability of Prana has been called Pranayama. In the above-mentioned<br>scriptures, Pranayama, Kumbhaka and purification of the body's nerves have been described as<br>essential for self-realization and health. With the regular practice of Pranayama, it is possible to achieve<br>Nadi Shodhana, Kundalini Awakening and deep states of meditation. Which leads the seeker towards<br>self-realization.<br>Objectives: The objective of this study is to present the types of Pranayama and their form described<br>in the eight scriptures of Hatha Yoga in a simple way at one place. By keeping the Pranayama described<br>in all the scriptures at one place, a comparative understanding can be developed in them.<br>Method: After critically studying the eight texts of Hathayoga (Hathayoga Pradipika, Gherand<br>Samhita, Shiv Samhita, Gorakshapaddhati, Yoga Beej, Vashishtha Samhita, Hatharatnavali,<br>Siddhasiddhanta Paddhati), the form of Pranayama has been published from them.<br>Result: Critical study of Pranayam in selected texts of Hatha Yoga has helped us in comparative and<br>detailed understanding of Pranayam propounded in different texts.</p>",

Software verification tools tend to assume the worst about any unconstrained behavior, and this can yield an enormous number of spurious warnings for open programs. For any serious verification effort, the engineer must invest time up-front in building a suitable model (or mock) of any missing code, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Inaccuracies in the mocks can lead to incorrect verification results.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we demonstrate a technique that is capable of distinguishing between false positives and actual bugs from potential memory-safety violations in an open program with high accuracy. Central to the technique is the ability of making&nbsp;<em>angelic</em> assumptions about missing code. To accomplish this, we first mine a set of idiomatic patterns in buffer-manipulating programs using a large language model (LLM). This is complemented by a formal synthesis strategy that performs property-directed reasoning to select, adapt, and instantiate these idiomatic patterns into angelic assumptions on the target program. Overall, our system,&nbsp;<em>Seeker</em>, guarantees that a program is deemed correct&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;if it can be verified under a well-defined set of ``trusted'' idiomatic patterns. In our experiments over a set of benchmarks curated from popular open-source software, our tool&nbsp;<em>Seeker</em> is able to identify 79% of the false positives with zero false negatives.</p>",
