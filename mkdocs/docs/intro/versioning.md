# Documentation Versioning

Awesome-Virome documentation uses versioning to maintain documentation for different versions of the project. This page explains how versioning works and how to navigate between different versions.

## Why Version Documentation?

Documentation versioning provides several benefits:

1. **Historical accuracy**: Users can access documentation that corresponds to the specific version of the project they're using
2. **Backward compatibility**: Changes or new features don't break documentation for users on older versions
3. **Upgrade planning**: Users can see what's changed between versions before upgrading
4. **Feature exploration**: Users can preview upcoming features in the latest version

## How Versioning Works

The Awesome-Virome documentation is organized into versioned snapshots:

- **Latest (Unreleased)**: Contains the most up-to-date documentation, including features not yet released
- **Versioned Releases**: Snapshots of documentation corresponding to specific project releases (e.g., 1.0.0)

## Navigating Between Versions

You can easily switch between documentation versions using the version selector in the header. The version selector shows all available versions of the documentation.

## Current Versions

| Version | Release Date | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Latest  | Unreleased   | Most up-to-date documentation, including unreleased features |
| 1.0.0   | May 3, 2025  | Initial version of the comprehensive documentation |

## Version-Specific Features

### Latest (Unreleased)

- Updated API endpoints
- Additional workflow examples

### 1.0.0

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation, your changes will be applied to the latest (unreleased) version. When a new version is released, a snapshot of the current state will be created as a new versioned documentation set.

See the [contribution guidelines](../contributing/guidelines.md) for more information on how to contribute to the documentation.
