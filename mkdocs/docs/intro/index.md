# Introduction to Awesome-Virome

> **Last Updated:** November 29, 2025

Welcome to the official documentation for Awesome-Virome, a curated list of software, tools, and databases useful for virome analysis, including phages, viruses, and their interactions with hosts.

## What is Virome Analysis?

Virome analysis involves studying the collection of viruses (including bacteriophages) in a specific environment such as the human gut, soil, or oceans. These analyses typically include:

1. Identifying viral sequences in metagenomic data
2. Classifying viruses and predicting their hosts
3. Assembling and annotating viral genomes
4. Analyzing viral diversity and evolution
5. Studying virus-host interactions and functional potential
