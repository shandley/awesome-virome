# Host Prediction Tools

Host prediction tools help determine the bacterial hosts of viral sequences, particularly phages. This is crucial for understanding phage-host interactions, designing phage therapy, and interpreting the role of phages in microbial communities.

## Key Host Prediction Tools

### iPHoP

[iPHoP](https://bitbucket.org/srouxjgi/iphop/src/main/) (Integrated Prediction of Host and Phage) is a state-of-the-art tool for predicting phage-host interactions at various taxonomic levels.

- **Version**: v1.3.3, 2023
- **Installation**: `conda install -c bioconda iphop`
- **GitHub Stars**: Hosted on Bitbucket
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates multiple prediction methods
  - Assigns confidence scores to predictions
  - Works at multiple taxonomic levels
  - Pre-trained with a comprehensive database
  - Optimized for metagenomic data

**Usage Example**:
```bash
iphop predict --fa_file input_phages.fasta --out_dir iphop_results
```

### CHERRY

[CHERRY](https://github.com/KennthShang/CHERRY) (v1.0, 2022) uses deep learning for phage host prediction.

- **GitHub Stars**: ⭐ 24
- **Installation**: `git clone https://github.com/KennthShang/CHERRY.git`
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses deep learning (CNN and LSTM)
  - Pre-trained with thousands of phage-host pairs
  - Works well with novel phages
  - Can make predictions at different taxonomic levels

**How It Works**:
CHERRY uses a combination of convolutional neural networks and LSTM to learn sequence patterns indicative of phage-host interactions.

### VirHostMatcher-Net

[VirHostMatcher-Net](https://github.com/WeiliWw/VirHostMatcher-Net) is a network-based virus-host prediction tool.

- **GitHub Stars**: ⭐ 21
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses both oligonucleotide frequencies and protein alignment
  - Incorporates network-based information
  - Achieves high accuracy at genus level
  - Works well with novel viruses

### WIsH

[WIsH](https://github.com/soedinglab/WIsH) (Who Is the Host) predicts phage-host interactions using genome homology.

- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Markov models of genomic composition
  - Fast and lightweight
  - Good performance on well-characterized host taxa
  - Works well with complete genomes

## Performance Benchmarks

Based on published benchmarks and community experience:

- **Genus level prediction**:
  - VirHostMatcher-Net: ~75-80% accuracy
  - iPHoP: ~70-75% accuracy
  - CHERRY: ~65-70% accuracy

- **Species level prediction**:
  - iPHoP: ~60-65% accuracy

*Note: Actual performance varies based on input data quality, completeness, and taxonomic coverage of reference databases.*

## Recommended Workflow

For optimal host prediction results, we recommend a multi-tool approach:

1. **Start with [iPHoP](https://bitbucket.org/srouxjgi/iphop/src/main/)**:
   - Comprehensive predictions with confidence scores
   - Good starting point for most analyses

2. **Complement with specialized tools**:
   - For well-studied hosts: [WIsH](https://github.com/soedinglab/WIsH) and [HostPhinder](https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HostPhinder/)
   - For novel phages: [CHERRY](https://github.com/KennthShang/CHERRY) and [VirHostMatcher-Net](https://github.com/WeiliWw/VirHostMatcher-Net)
   - If CRISPR data is available: [CrisprOpenDB](https://github.com/GuillaumeLabas/CrisprOpenDB) and [SpacePHARER](https://github.com/soedinglab/spacepharer)

3. **Consensus approach**:
   - Take predictions agreed upon by multiple methods
   - Weight predictions by confidence scores when available
   - Consider biological context (e.g., environment of isolation)

## Future Directions

The field of phage host prediction is rapidly evolving:

- **Integration of metagenomic co-occurrence data**
